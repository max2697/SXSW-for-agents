  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Decisions about land, conservation, food and energy systems, and climate are increasingly shaped by data and AI. But how does that information actually enter a decision? How does a farmer decide when to plant, or a policymaker weigh risk and uncertainty? This fireside chat explores how data-driven insights move from analysis to real-world decision-making across very different contexts, and what it takes for data and models to be reliable enough to act on when the stakes are high.</p>
