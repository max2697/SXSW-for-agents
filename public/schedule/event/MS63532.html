  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Sasha Wrist is a bilingual singer-songwriter and vocal artist from Venezuela, now based in Los
Angeles. Her genre-bending sound fuses the grit of hip-hop, the pulse of electronic music, the
sensuality of R&amp;B, and the emotional depth of Latin pop. 

Her voice first gained traction in the global music scene through the viral success of her Splice
vocal packs, which have been downloaded and sampled by producers worldwide, incorporating Sasha’s vocals into standout tracks like “Famax” and “Perreo”.

In late 2024, Sasha released her debut album, LA CHAMA. More than just a debut, the album serves as a love letter to her Venezuelan roots. Tracks like “SUR,” “CORO,” “KRTELUO,” and “LLANEROS” explore her upbringing, resilience, and self-discovery. 

Beginning in early 2025, Sasha made a sharp artistic pivot with the release of The Wrist
Wave, a melodic house EP with tracks like “Ya Te Borre,” and “IGOT2.&quot; She also collaborated with some of the world’s biggest phonk artists, Ariis, YB Wasg&#39;ood, and Nakama, on their track “LUNA LA.”

Sasha Wrist&#39;s next project, titled &quot;404:NJD&quot; will release in February 15 and will bring her back to rap roots.</p>
