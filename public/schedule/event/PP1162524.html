  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Africas music market is one of the fastest-growing and most dynamic in the world but success depends on more than a viral hit. In this session we’ll unpack the strategies behind breaking artists across the continent and beyond. From navigating fragmented streaming platforms and hyper-local radio to street teams, fan communities, and brand collabs, you’ll hear what works, what flops and what it takes to build lasting careers in Africa’s diverse music scenes. Expect a real case study of how one artist cracked the local market and the roadmap that turned regional buzz into international momentum.</p>
