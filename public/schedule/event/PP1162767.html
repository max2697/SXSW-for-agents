  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>I know, I know: you’ve seen it all before. In 2016-2020, many people thought VR would be *the thing*. It didn’t happen, and you’ve moved on. We didn’t. See: VR is cool, actually. Talk to any creative, any filmmaker: they want in. Why? BECAUSE IT’S AWESOME! Come to this talk and learn how the latest cameras and headsets *finally* make it easy to create mind-blowing experiences. I’ll show you a few projects that came out recently, share some audience numbers - and you’ll get why Immersive Videos are the most undervalued creative opportunity at the moment!</p>
