      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;I&#39;m a literary manager at Writ Large. \r\r\r\rI help writers, directors and authors manage their careers and develop as artists.\r\r\r\rI have extensive experience in all aspects of the entertainment industry including production, development, film finance, branded content and business operations. Through this varied work I have amassed an extensive network and diverse set of skills and knowledge that I use to help filmmakers build their careers. \r\r\r\rI cut my teeth in the New York production offices of big studio movies like THE DEPARTED, THE INTERPRETER and AMERICAN GANGSTER. When I moved to LA, I transitioned to development and film finance at Groundswell Productions (MILK, THE INFORMANT and THE VISITOR). Then after a stint in operations at Illumination Entertainment (DESPICABLE ME, MINIONS), I have spent the past few years working on my own digital media startups and producing branded content.&quot;,
