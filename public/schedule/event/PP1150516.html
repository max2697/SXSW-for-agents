  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Netflix’s Director of Unscripted Casting Rich Leist helped launch Netflix’s first in-house unscripted casting team, giving him a front-row seat to what platforms are actually looking for when they decide who gets on screen.  Joining him is Matt Nagorner, formerly a Warner Bros. unscripted talent lead and now co-president of IM Trying Productions, where he develops personality-driven unscripted series and formats. 

This meet-up is designed for connection first: a quick, candid kickoff on what’s working in unscripted right now (casting, talent packaging, formats, and where the market is moving), followed by plenty of time for fans, aspiring cast, producers, and suppliers to meet each other, swap intel, and leave with new contacts. Along the way, Matt can pull back the curtain on working across major franchises like The Bachelor, The Voice, and event specials including **Friends: The Reunion and the **Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Matthew Nagorner is a seasoned television executive and creative producer with over 15 years of experience spanning both scripted and unscripted television.\r\rHe began his career at Warner Bros. Television in 2010, working closely with legendary\rshowrunner Chuck Lorre across some of the most successful multi-camera comedies of the\rmodern era, including Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, Mike &amp; Molly, and Mom.\rDuring this formative period, Matthew gained hands-on experience in high-volume production, writer-driven storytelling, and the inner workings of top-tier network television.\rIn 2016, Matthew transitioned into Warner Bros. Unscripted Television, where he quickly\rbecame a key creative force across some of the company’s most iconic franchises and live-\revent programming. His credits include work on The Bachelor franchise, The Voice, and large-\rscale cultural moments such as the Friends Reunion and Harry Potter Reunion specials.\rRising through the ranks, Matthew ultimately served as Talent Lead for Warner Bros.\rUnscripted, where he specialized in developing original series and formats built around high-profile scripted and unscripted talent across television, streaming, and emerging platforms. In\rthis role, he was instrumental in shaping projects from early concept through pitch, packaging, and sale.\r\rMost recently, Matthew wrapped as the executive overseeing creative and structure\ron Bachelor Mansion Takeover, further solidifying his reputation for marrying franchise\rstorytelling with fresh format innovation.\r\rWith a career rooted in both premium scripted comedy and top-tier unscripted programming, Matthew brings a rare, cross-disciplinary perspective to development—combining talent-first strategy, sharp creative instincts, and a deep understanding of what resonates with audiences.\r\rIn January 2026, Matthew departed Warner Bros. Unscripted to launch IMT\rProductions, teaming up with prolific showrunner Ian Gelfand under 3BMG. The\rcompany builds on Matthew’s years of experience developing talent-driven and\rpremium unscripted series, with a focus on bold ideas and elevated storytelling. IMT\rProductions already has two projects set up at various networks and streamers, marking a\rstrong start out of the gate.&quot;,
