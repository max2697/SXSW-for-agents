  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Audiences are increasingly turning to content creators for everything from quick news recaps to in-depth explainers, raising urgent questions about standards and credibility. Is this shift the future of journalism or the erosion of it? Building on original data from the Pew-Knight Initiative and insights from the creator economy, this session will explore how the definition of “journalism” is evolving in real time. We will go beyond debate to identify the tools, norms, and strategic shifts needed to preserve public trust in a creator-driven information ecosystem.</p>
