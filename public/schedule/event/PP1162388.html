  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>In a world where AI tools can generate logos, write copy, and compose music in seconds, what does creativity look like for the rest of us—especially those who don’t carry a “creative” title? This workshop is for the engineers, strategists, analysts, producers, and anyone else who’s ever said, “I’m not creative.” Through a series of provocative exercises and hands-on prompts, we’ll explore how creativity is evolving beyond traditional mediums—into product flows, systems thinking, code, and prompt design.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Brian Larson helps brands find what truly matters and say it in ways that stick. As a Senior Strategy Lead at Instrument, he untangles the messiest problems and turns them into stories people can feel. He’s worked with Uber, Microsoft, AT&amp;T, Epic Games, and adidas—not just to make them look good, but to make them meaningful.\r\rBefore this, Brian led marketing for Instrument and Raw Materials—two creative agencies responsible for rethinking how the world’s biggest brands show up. His job? To do for them what they do for their clients: clarify who they are, why they exist, and how to grow.\r\rBefore brands, there was science. As a NASA-funded biochemist, Brian studied how systems adapt and evolve, and it’s still how he sees the world. Creativity, to him, is evolution in real-time—adaptation and connection that lead to something greater.\r\rHe lives in Portland, Oregon, with his family, chasing what’s next.&quot;,
