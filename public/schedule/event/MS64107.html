  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Neptune XXI is a multidisciplinary artist, storyteller, and cultural architect whose work fuses the spiritual with the sonic. Raised in Northeast Washington, D.C., shaped by Southern lineage, and sharpened by Baltimore’s creative edge, she creates at the intersection of healing, futurism, and ancestral memory. A graduate of Mount St. Mary’s University and author of From My Mind’s Eye, she bridges scholarship with soul, weaving language, sound, and movement into transformative experiences.

Praised by The Baltimore Sun for her “rhythmic mastery and profound syntax,” Neptune XXI has been a resonant voice in contemporary art since her debut EP TwentyOne (2018). Her catalog, including HEAL (2023), Medicine Music (2024), and Medicine Music II (2026) reflects her commitment to collective restoration, emotional liberation, and reclaimed joy. On stage, her performances become multisensory experiences blending music, poetry, and hella swag.

She is also Founder of the non-profit, Nu Indigo Nation, cultivating safe, self-sustaining futures for Black people through art, education, and wellness.</p>
