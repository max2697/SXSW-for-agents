  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Cultural backlash killed the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) framework as a tool for motivating and measuring action on climate and social justice—proving that publicly traded companies are not going to drive us to a radically better economy. What is it? Nature-positive finance, a new approach that’s holistic, comprehensive, and resilient to political and stock market shifts. Three impact investing leaders illustrate the idea in practice, with a focus on finding scalable place-based strategies, spotting system change opportunities, and tying environmental impact to social impact.</p>
