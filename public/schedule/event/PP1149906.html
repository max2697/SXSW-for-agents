      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Zoë Lustri (she/her) is a 2x award-losing film composer and music producer based in Manchester, UK. She loves to write music and hates to write bios.\n\nShe began her life in music from the tender age of 5 years old--writing classic hits about playtime and the struggles of parents telling you what to do. From then the ball was rolling and it hasn&#39;t stopped.\n\nZoë holds a Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Film Scoring from Berklee College of Music. Upon graduating, she moved to Los Angeles where she interned for some famous people with questionable ethics. Since then, she has worked with cool people with morals at Joy Music House where she has worked in score production on a variety of projects including the Emmy &amp;amp; Oscar nominated RBG, and Emile Mosseri&#39;s Oscar nominated, BAFTA award winning score to Minari.\n\nWhen she is not enveloped in music for media, Zoë is working on her personal songs and artistry. In 2020, Zoë Lustri shocked the world when she released her debut single Something Good. A song that a random Indie blog once said “[sounds] absolutely great, but unfortunately I feel it sounds a little too commercial for my playlist”. Something Good features strong, prominent vocals exploring introspective lyrics as a conversation on depression while giving a sonic palette that is both ambient, cinematic, and driving. Her productions have been labeled as both \&quot;too interesting for [her] vocals to hold up to\&quot; and also \&quot;outshone by the vocal delivery\&quot;. As an artist she is distinctly emotive, and, according to one Instagram user, \&quot;can&#39;t sing\&quot;. With an impressive 840 Instagram followers and 184 Spotify followers, Zoë Lustri is redefining the word \&quot;icon\&quot;. Her single Something Good was succeeded with EPs Down The River and Occult Sh*t, which features the award-nominated track Secrets.\n\nZoë is a voting member of The Recording Academy, and she proudly sits on the board of The Alliance for Women Film Composers, actively pushing for gender equity in the world of film composing.&quot;,
