  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Hi Austin! I’m DJ Anupi, an Austin local with over 12 years in the music scene. My passion for DJing began in high school, driven by a desire to blend beats from the East and West and bring the best of both worlds together. Growing up listening to mostly Bollywood/South Asian music, I gravitated toward fusing global sounds with western styles. I started by creating mashups and quickly discovered my love for bringing people together and creating memories on the dance floor. What began as DJing high school dances soon evolved into spinning downtown on 6th Street, and eventually launching my own sound and events company. Through this journey, I’ve DJed everything from weddings and corporate events to large-scale public parties across Texas and the U.S. Running my events company gave me the opportunity to experience music from many cultures and styles around the world, further shaping my identity as a fusion DJ. Today, my style blends global rhythms and modern beats designed to move crowds and create memories. Recently, I’ve also stepped into music production, crafting remixes that I’m excited to start sharing on SoundCloud. Looking forward to SXSW 2026! See you on the dance floor!</p>
