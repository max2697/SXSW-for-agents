  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The music industry is often categorized by sensationalized classes of either rich superstars or &quot;starving artists&quot; – and we often miss an opportunity to talk about its middle class who have learned to create a living from the craft they love. So what does the redefining of success in music looks like? We&#39;ll take you inside real case studies for you to learn how to build a sustainable, balanced career without selling out or burning out. Whether you&#39;re an artist, producer, or songwriter, the &quot;middle class&quot; can be achieved by staying focused on something that&#39;s real rather than in the rearview.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Blending elements of jazz, neo-soul, and R&amp;amp;B, New York-based singer-songwriter Shoni has been carving her own lane in R&amp;amp;B Soul music since her 2019 debut single “Good Vibes.” Her seductive soprano, emotionally rich songwriting, and commanding stage presence draw listeners into themes of healing, empowerment, and self-love.\n\nIn 2025, Shoni released her acclaimed EP Shades of Blues, a deeply personal, sonically lush project that earned a feature on Tidal Thursday and placement on Tidal’s Grown R&amp;amp;B playlist. The project also landed her a spot on the Recording Academy’s Grammy U November Mixtape, and she proudly served as a Music Advocate for the Recording Academy’s Music Advocacy Day, representing independent artists and women in music.\n\nShoni has also expanded her horizons into the world of audiobook narration, where she has lent her warm Southern American accent to several romance, self-help, urban fiction, and fiction novels. Her talent has earned her recognition in the music and audio industries, establishing her as a versatile, emerging star.\n\nAs a passionate creative since childhood, Shoni began singing at age five after being inspired by a Whitney Houston performance, and later studied jazz and classical music in college. Beyond her artistry, she’s a storyteller and entrepreneur, the owner of Soulfully Written Productions in New York City and the host of the Beauty &amp;amp; Soul Podcast, a platform empowering creatives to explore conversations around the “B-side of life, love, and business of music.”\n\nShoni’s artistry reflects resilience, womanhood, and authenticity, offering soulful soundscapes that remind listeners to feel deeply, love freely, and live intentionally.&quot;,

Starting at just $800, they ultimately led the studio to an exit valuation of nearly $20 million.\n&quot;,
