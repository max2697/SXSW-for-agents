  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Isak Thomas and The Stoop Boys is a soul/funk collective of artists primarily based out of Austin, Texas, and Nashville. Originally founded in Boston, MA, by Isak “Thomas” Kotecki (keyboard/guitar/vocals) in 2017, Isak began collaborating with close friends from music school, Connor Frawley (bass/vocals) and John Cattini (lead guitar/vocals), with a shared love of ’70s soul, funk, and rock music.
When the three eventually moved their separate ways across the country, they continued to convene once a year for a week of writing and recording. This tradition has stayed true through three EPs and two albums, garnering millions of streams and features such as KUTX’s Song of the Day.
The group has a unique take on its writing process, with every member serving as a rotating writer and vocalist, centered around native Austinite Isak Kotecki as producer. In the latest full album release, &#39;The Stoop Boys&#39;, the group saw the addition of Armando Baeza (drums/vocals) and Logan “Wildman” Garza (vocals/percussion), also joining as writers.
The Stoop Boys aim to bring music that feels like yesterday, hits like today, and sticks with you tomorrow.</p>
