      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Brooke began her career in 2012 working with writers, directors, and producers in Scripted Television at Creative Artist Agency (CAA). During her time at CAA, she worked her way up to become the assistant to a Scripted TV Literary Agent, where she learned how a show goes from conception to launch.

She then leveraged her expertise in content strategy, marketing, and creators to become the first social media manager for VidCon, where she ran social media for the convention, shaped their editorial voice, and expanded their social reach. Now as the Head of Creator Development at Snapchat, Brooke’s work with creators, celebrities, and talent has been integral in helping creators of all kinds find success in a highly competitive market, strengthening Snapchat’s relationship with creators. Whether Brooke is educating creators on the platform, advising on content strategy or facilitating partnerships, she is a strategic advisor guiding creators along their journey on Snapchat.&quot;,
