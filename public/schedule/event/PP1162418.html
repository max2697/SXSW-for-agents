  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>AI may make life easier, but at what cost to our imagination? Like a bike we stop riding, our creativity weakens when we overrely on AI. Still, while adults may feel rusty, we can get back on. For children, the risk is even greater: if they never build that muscle in the first place—never learn to ride at all—there’s nothing to return to. This all comes just as jobs are being disrupted, problems grow more complex, and we need more imagination, not less. This panel explores how we can grow creatively with AI (versus be diminished by it) and what we must build now to make that future possible.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Ned Johnson is the president and founder of PrepMatters. A professional tutor-geek since 1993, Mr. Johnson has devoted in excess of 35,000 hours in one-on-one test prep for nearly the entire alphabet of tests. His experience includes work with all ages and abilities in preparation for SSAT and ISEE to ACT and SAT to GMAT, GRE and LSAT.\r\rConsidered by many to be the most sought-after instructor in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, Mr. Johnson has served area students as well as clients from across the country and around the globe.  In addition to his time with clients, Mr. Johnson oversees instructor hiring and training, curriculum development, business management, and coffee purchases.\r\rA 1993 graduate of Williams College, Mr. Johnson has a BA in Economics and Political Science. Originally from Connecticut (he can drive in snow), Mr. Johnson now resides with his wife and children in Washington, DC.\r\rPeople often believe standardized tests are IQ tests.  They aren’t.\r\rYou have to know what’s on the tests.  You have to know how to do what’s on them.  And, you have to be able to do your best on any given day.  All are knowledge and skills that you can develop — that’s what I help you do.  Along the way, we might even help you learn more about the ways you study, think and perform that can could be meaningful to you long after you have forgotten what your test scores were.&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Andrea Virgin is a visionary leader whose life and work exist at the crossroads of creativity and resilience. A former professional ballerina turned civil engineer, entrepreneur, and nonprofit founder, her journey embodies the power of reinvention—and how creativity, when embraced across every field of life, can be profoundly transformative.\n\nAfter performing with Houston Ballet II and Ballet Florida, Andrea earned degrees from Florida Atlantic University and Cornell University, transitioning from the stage to the built environment. She went on to launch her own firm, Virgin Design, where she infused human-centered creativity into land development. Once an anomaly for bridging the arts and engineering, she became determined to make creativity the rule in a future that demands more imagination, not less.\n\nThat mission inspired her founding of The Center, where she serves as Chair &amp;amp; CEO. Under her leadership, The Center has raised nearly $25 million, engaged Pritzker Prize-winning Renzo Piano Building Workshop, and positioned itself to redefine creativity and its role in society for the 21st century.\n\nA sought-after speaker on creativity, resilience, and technology, Andrea has been featured at CreativeMornings, BitBasel, Leading Between the Lines, Launching Simplified, and Quantum Beach 2025. Her work has been recognized by Palm Beach Illustrated’s Women On Top, The Palm Beach 100, and Boca Magazine’s Fantastic Four.\n\nWhen she’s not leading transformative initiatives, Andrea finds creative renewal with her daughters and husband—or on the ballroom dance floor at Fred Astaire Dance Studio in Boca Raton.&quot;,
