  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Most leaders are taught to narrow themselves to fit the world. But what if innovation requires the opposite? In this intimate fireside chat, Tony Martignetti shares insights from his latest book, Illuminating Hidden Brilliance, revealing how reclaiming the sidelined parts of our identity is the key to creativity, connection, and transformative leadership. Through stories, research, and practical tools, Tony shows how multidimensional thinking becomes a catalyst and why the future belongs to leaders who bring all of themselves to the table. Attendees will learn why a multidimensional perspective is a strategic advantage, how to spot hidden brilliance in themselves and others, and how organizations can create environments where people can think and lead beyond the one-dimensional demands of modern work.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Tony Martignetti is a leadership and workplace culture advisor and change catalyst who helps leaders and teams navigate complexity without losing themselves in the process. With over 30 years of experience across high-tech and life sciences, Tony has worked in organizations where innovation, pressure, and uncertainty collide. Along the way, he discovered a truth that now defines his work: brilliance doesn’t disappear in organizations; it goes dormant when people are asked to fragment themselves to perform.\nThrough his company, Inspired Purpose Partners, Tony designs transformational experiences that unlock what he calls multidimensional leadership: the ability to integrate purpose, presence, creativity, and connection while making a meaningful impact. His work helps leaders gain clarity, make better decisions, and lead in ways that are both human and sustainable.\nTony is the best-selling author of Climbing the Right Mountain and Campfire Lessons for Leaders, the host of The Virtual Campfire Podcast, and a sought-after global keynote speaker. He is known for creating spaces, often described as “campfires,” where people can speak honestly, think expansively, and reconnect with who they are becoming. His work blends proven leadership frameworks with storytelling, design thinking, and deep relational practice to turn insight into action.&quot;,
