      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Sol is the Global Director of Innovation at Magnopus, a pioneering company that creates extraordinary experiences and technology that bridges the physical and digital worlds. Recently deployed to re-imaging &#39;The Wizard of Oz&#39; for The Sphere in Las Vegas, challenged to bring &#39;Daft Punk&#39; to Fortnite and defined a whole new paradigm in film making through the development of virtual production for &#39;Disney’s The Lion King&#39;.\r\r\rA sought-after keynote speaker and trusted advisor, Sol was awarded his PHD in 2025 for his impact to the &#39;Emerging Creative Technology&#39; industries and exuberantly works with startups, nonprofits, and governments to shape the future. He proudly serves as Chairman of BAFTA’s Immersive Entertainment Advisory Group, an OECD Global Technology Advisor, and Chairman of Immerse UK, the UK government’s nationwide network for immersive industries.\r\r\rBefore Magnopus he was the Founder of REWIND, a spatial technology company that gained global recognition as a pioneer in the VR and AR space which he built and sold over 10 years. If you ask him about his most rewarding job though he would probably say that a decade as a University Professor in Video Games, Visual Effects, and Emerging Technology, where he taught 1000&#39;s of students and developed cutting-edge degree programmes, supervised PhD research, and helped shape the next generation of creative technologists.\r\r\rFor Sol, time is life’s most valuable currency. True success is about mastering it — choosing how to spend it, who to spend it with, and what to create with it. That’s why, above all else, he cherishes his greatest achievement: his wild, identical twin boys.\r&quot;,
