  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Ozer, San Francisco’s own, has been cultivating his lyrical voice since the age of six, first turning to music as a refuge from life’s challenges and later sharpening his craft through the influence of artists like J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, and Nipsey Hussle. What began as inspiration evolved into intention as Ozer matured—transforming lived experience into honest, reflective songwriting grounded in execution, flow, and substance. Following the release of his latest EP Fog City, he has shared stages with Westside Boogie, Topaz Jones, Trayce Chapman, YGTUT, and more, solidifying his presence as a formidable and thoughtful emcee. A writer at heart and performer by nature, Ozer uses language as a lyrical canvas, drawing from the essence of real life to create music that resonates with clarity, purpose, and lasting impact.</p>
