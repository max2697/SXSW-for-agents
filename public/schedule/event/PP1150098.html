  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Texas has always been the frontier of America’s biggest ideas - from cattle drives to microchips, music revolutions to moonshots. In 2026, the frontier is shifting upward, and the call for the New Space Cowboy is here.  In this era of commercial space, the next giant leap won’t be driven by astronauts, but welders, coders, machinists, technicians, scientists, mission operators, and dreamers. And no place on Earth is better positioned to cultivate this next gen of talent. Join the Space Workforce Incubator for Texas for a meetup that blends the spirit of the Wild West with the future&#39;s promise.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Geoff Tudor is President of the Space Workforce Incubator for Texas (SWIFT), a non-profit dedicated to ensuring Texas is the global leader in the space workforce. Geoff started his career as Legislative Director to Congressman Lamar Smith, former Chairman of the House Science Committee. While on Capitol Hill, Geoff authored the first commercial space launch amendments to enable scientific payloads to fly on private rockets. He led Congressional funding for the Clementine Lunar Mission that discovered evidence of ice on the Moon, as well as funding for the Delta Clipper, the first rocket to demonstrate reusability.\r\rAfter his time in Congress, Geoff moved to Austin and received his MBA from the University of Texas. While at UT, he started GNS Software, which was acquired by Symantec. He then co-founded the cloud storage company Nirvanix, which was acquired by Oracle. Today, in addition to leading SWIFT, he leads global cloud storage solutions go-to-market at NetApp, a $6 billion publicly traded technology company.&quot;,
