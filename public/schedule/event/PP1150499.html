  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>People often feel powerless to create social change. Issues like climate change, misinformation, and the erosion of democracy are “wicked” problems. They are complex, multifaceted, global challenges with no simple solutions. How can anyone make a difference when it comes to problems like these? Drawing from philosophy, history, and contemporary social science, this talk offers tools for thinking in new ways about how individuals can help create transformative social change. Each of us can make a difference, but not in the ways we usually think.</p>
