  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Habitat loss, climate change, and disease are threatening the ecological integrity of our planet. These threats are driving declines in wildlife populations, accelerated by the loss of genetic diversity. Biobanking, including the cryopreservation of living cells, coupled with advanced digital tools, provides an opportunity for a future where genetic diversity, species, and ecosystems can be protected and restored. This panel will discuss the urgency of protecting species—from microbes to megafauna—and how biobanking and digital strategies are helping give wildlife a lifeline.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;As a wildlife ecologist, Dr. Rae Wynn-Grant has expertise in uncovering how human activity influences carnivore behavior and ecology. As co-host of the Emmy® nominated series, Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom Protecting the Wild and its companion podcast, Dr. Wynn-Grant advocates for increased diversity among guests and the production crew, resulting in a stronger, more inclusive culture on set. She’s committed to sustainable practices to reduce the Wild Kingdom production’s environmental impact, and helped identify ways to reduce carbon emissions on set. This helped the series achieve the Environmental Media Association’s green seal certification.  \r\rA native Californian, she attributes her interest in wildlife and conservation to the television shows she watched as a child, including the iconic original series, Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom. She&#39;s passionate about science communication and is the creator and host of the award-winning podcast, “Going Wild with Dr. Rae Wynn-Grant.”  Dr. Wynn-Grant&#39;s memoir, “Wild Life,” explores the relationship between humans, animals and the earth through her personal journey to becoming a wildlife ecologist. She&#39;s also a research fellow with the National Geographic Society. &quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Dr. Nadine Lamberski is a globally recognized leader in wildlife health, species recovery, and conservation strategy. As Chief Conservation and Wildlife Health Officer for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, she oversees one of the world’s most comprehensive programs for safeguarding biodiversity—uniting veterinary expertise, scientific discovery, and field-based conservation across multiple continents.\n\nWith more than three decades of experience advancing health and resilience of wildlife populations, Dr. Lamberski and her team have shaped innovative, evidence-driven approaches to nature conservation. Her leadership has strengthened global capacity in endangered species management, advanced biobanking and genetic rescue initiatives, and expanded collaborative efforts with partners such as IUCN, government agencies, NGO’s, universities, and local communities.\n\nDr. Lamberski is known for connecting the care of individual animals to the survival of entire species, demonstrating how outstanding animal care in accredited zoos, aquariums, and botanic gardens accelerates global conservation outcomes. She has authored numerous scientific publications, led pioneering health interventions for critically endangered species, and steered initiatives that bridge veterinary science, ecology, and community-based conservation.\n\nA respected mentor and advisor, Dr. Lamberski champions cross-disciplinary innovation and helps guide conservation organizations as they shift from fragmented approaches to holistic stewardship of nature. Her work reflects a core belief that healthy ecosystems—and the wildlife within them—are fundamental to human well-being, cultural heritage, and economic resilience.\n\n\n\n&quot;,
