  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Chuck Prophet’s streak of more than a dozen critically acclaimed solo records stretches all the way back to 1990, when the California native first shifted focus from his tenure with pioneering neo-psych band Green on Red to working under his own name. Since then, his songs have appeared in a slew of films and television shows, and his work has been covered by Bruce Springsteen, Solomon Burke, Heart, and a host of others. Rolling Stone dubbed him a “streetwise city kid with an eye for the country,” while Uncut proclaimed him a “renaissance-rocker,” and NPR declared that “no one can turn tales from the outer limits into catchy songs quite like Prophet does.” 

Wake The Dead, Chuck Prophet’s extraordinary new album recorded with ¿Qiensave?, dives headfirst into the world of Cumbia music. The songs are intoxicatingly rhythmic, all but demanding you move your body while you listen. There are flashes of rock and roll, punk, surf, and soul, wrapped up in the rich legacy of a genre that traces its roots back hundreds of years and thousands of miles.</p>
