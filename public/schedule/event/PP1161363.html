  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Our panel of experienced lawyers brings different perspectives to the evolving Title IX legal landscape. We are student advocates, policy designers, and on-the-ground implementers. We will share strategies for transforming Title IX challenges into opportunities and explore how forward-thinking institutions can move from reactive approaches toward sustainable, sound policies and fair processes that serve all students. Through case studies and practical frameworks, participants will learn strategies for balancing legal requirements with institutional values in the classroom and beyond.</p>

She provides hands-on assistance in building centralized offices of institutional equity, writing policies and procedures, conducting investigations, serving as an external decision-maker and appellate authority, and developing and delivering training programs for Title IX Coordinators, institutional equity personnel, decision-makers, investigators, and other implementers and leaders.\r\rInstitutions regularly call upon Maureen to conduct external policy audits regarding Title IX, Title VI, and other civil rights laws; reviews of institutional responses to current or historical reports of sexual and gender-based harassment and violence; and child protection audits. She also assists schools in meeting federal compliance obligations and responding to investigations by the Office for Civil Rights and the Clery Compliance Division of the U.S. Department of Education.\r\rAs a seasoned investigator, Maureen manages and conducts Title IX and civil rights investigations. She also serves as an external hearing officer, panel chair, and legal consultant to decision-makers in Title IX, discrimination, harassment, and related conduct cases.\r\rMaureen served as Interim Director of Civil Rights and Title IX at Amherst College (2024); Interim Director of Investigations at a large state university, restructuring their intake and investigative processes (2018-2019); and Interim Title IX Coordinator at Baylor University, helping to build Baylor’s Office of Institutional Equity (2017-2018). She currently leads a team of IRG attorneys who serve as equity consultants for Michigan State University, reviewing policies, procedures, and case files and reporting on legal compliance and effective practices.\r\rMaureen co-chairs the firm’s Education Industry team, helping identify, develop, and connect education leaders with legal advisors and experienced professionals within and outside of Cozen O’Connor. Maureen is also actively involved in the firm’s diversity initiatives and has previously served on the firm’s Member Committee and Hiring Committee. Maureen currently serves on the boards of Face to Face Germantown and Central Division Victim Services (CDVS) and is the co-chair of the Philadelphia Bar Association&#39;s LGBTQ+ Rights Committee. In 2020, Maureen was recognized as one of the best LGBTQ+ Lawyers under 40 by the LGBT Bar.
