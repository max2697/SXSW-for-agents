  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Can industry partnerships lead to scientific breakthroughs? Can climate science support business interests? Partnerships lead to win-win outcomes: business needs sparking scientific “Eureka!” moments and science innovation supporting business decisions. Join the non-profit University Corporation for Atmospheric Research for a talk at the nexus of science and industry: a research institution connecting climate science to real-world users, a startup using quantum sensors to detect oil and gas leaks, and an exploration company realizing efficiencies and reducing emissions with new technologies.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Greg Rieker is Professor and Provost’s Endowed Chair in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, and co-founder and CTO of LongPath Technologies. His work aims to improve energy and atmospheric systems through laser-based sensing. In particular, Greg leads teams to translate the power of frequency comb lasers into practical sensors for a variety of challenging measurements.  Over the past decade, Greg led a team from the University of Colorado and NIST to transition Nobel-prize-winning frequency comb laser technology from a complex laboratory device to an automated, regional-scale methane leak detection system.  The team formed LongPath Technologies, Inc. in 2018 to commercialize the system into the first broadly scalable continuous monitoring system for oil and gas infrastructure.  In the time since, LongPath and its industry partners established Basin-SCAN, a 600+ square mile continuous monitoring network in the active oil and gas production regions of the western US.   LongPath was recently awarded a $163M loan from the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office to establish a 25,000 square mile expansion of the network.   &quot;,
