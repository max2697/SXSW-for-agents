Before joining Mars, she served as Chief Digital Officer and Chief Communications Officer for Nutrition and Ice Cream at Unilever North America, where she led digital, e commerce, media, PR partnership, and acquisition strategies for brands like Breyers, Talenti, and Hellmann’s. She first made her mark] at Unilever on Klondike, reinventing the legendary “What Would You Do for a Klondike Bar?” campaign and driving the brand to double digit growth. She later revitalized Good Humor, famously bringing back the iconic ice cream truck.\r\rLeslie also led product and advertising development for Klondike, Magnum, Popsicle, and Good Humor — a $600M portfolio — and launched the British sensitive skin brand Simple into the North American market. She even helped keep young men smelling great with Axe Personal Wash. Her passion for impact began even earlier at the American Cancer Society, where she raised over $1M to support the fight against cancer.\r\rIn 2024, Leslie joined Kellanova — now Taste &amp; Nutrition Accelerator within Mars Snacking — where she leads Sweet Snacking Marketing and oversees a $2BN+ portfolio spanning Pop Tarts, Rice Krispies Treats, RXBAR, Nutri Grain, Special K bars, and Pure Organic.
