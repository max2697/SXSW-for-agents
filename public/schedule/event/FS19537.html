  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Grace Pine, a driven though easily distracted 23-year-old. She leaves her quirky parents’ home for a shared apartment found on Craigslist to devote herself to writing the next great book in the 33 1/3 album exploration series. Hers will be on the iconic Alanis Morissette opus Jagged Little Pill. Loft parties introduce Grace to two paramours. Unfortunately, they are members of the same rock band, Bone Patrol. And instead of sequestering herself away to complete her draft, she uses her music industry know-how to get in with the band as their publicist.Through wine-fuelled poetry readings and other ill-advised choices, Grace is in the trenches of self-discovery.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Chandler Levack grew up in Burlington, Ontario and lives in Toronto, where she studied cinema at the University of Toronto and screenwriting at the Canadian Film Centre. \n\nShe started her career as a music critic, writing for SPIN, The Village Voice and The Globe &amp; Mail. She has directed numerous music videos for bands that include PUP and Jeremy Dutcher, earning two JUNO nominations.\n\nIn 2022, Levack&#39;s debut as a writer/director I LIKE MOVIES, premiered at TIFF in 2022. The film is a coming of age comedy and is based on her experiences working at Blockbuster Video in the early 2000&#39;s. It was named to TIFF’s annual year-end Canada’s Top Ten list for 2022 and won four awards at the Vancouver Film Critics Circle Awards 2022 (including best Film and best Screenplay). \n\nChandler is currently in post on the Netflix/Happy Madison feature ROOMMATES, written by Jimmy Fowlie and Ceara O’Sullivan, and starring Sadie Sandler. Her second feature, MILE END KICKS, will premiere as the opening night film of TIFF&#39;s Special Presentations lineup this year. The film is based on Levack&#39;s experiences as a young female rock critic living in Montreal’s Mile End,  at the time when Grimes and Mac DeMarco were beginning their careers. It stars Barbie Ferreira, Jay Baruchel, Devon Bostick and Stanley Simons.&quot;,
