  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The next wave of sports fandom won’t be built in stadiums; it’ll be built in-game. From the NBA’s digital court activations to Fortnite’s immersive events and EA Sports’ evolving cultural platform, the lines between sport and play are blurring fast. This panel explores how gaming is reshaping how fans engage with sport, not just watching, but emulating, remixing, and co-creating it. The future of global sport is interactive, creator-powered, and playable.</p>
