  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Victor Jones has taken off tremendously in the past year and change, hitting a over million streams on spotify in 2025 alone, with success on tracks such as Mother Teresa and I Get Hurt boosted by strong short form social media campaigns. Victor comes from a background of comedy and theater as much as music, and it shows through even (especially?) in his darkest songs.

Victor plays with a modular backing band consisting of 1-2 people and carefully arranged backing tracks. His shows are high energy, danceable, and chantable. He prides himself on having, at least in the past year, made people cry at every show, and alternately, made them dance.</p>
