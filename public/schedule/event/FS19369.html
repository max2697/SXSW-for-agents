  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>It sucks to be Brian. He’s smart, funny, and capable, but his mental health issues make it hard for anyone to see it - especially when compared to his effortlessly cool older brother. At school, Brian harbors an unrequited crush on Brooke: she’s smart, kind, pretty… and very much his teacher. A disastrous drama club audition leads to yet another one of Brian’s trademark public meltdowns. Thus begins Brian’s search for his new “thing”. On paper he’s chosen the worst possible fit: running for class president. With help from his therapist and the new kid, Justin, Brian launches his high-stakes campaign and sparks a messy, exquisitely awkward journey toward self-acceptance.</p>
