  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Casmalia is a producer, DJ, songwriter, and live vocalist based out of Los Angeles who has taken the west coast house music scene by storm. A classically trained musician with a degree in audio engineering, Casmalia has been consistently churning out club weapons since her freshman EP in 2017 on Hood Politics Records. She has since earned affiliations with Insomniac Records, mau5trap, CUFF, Night Bass, and many more. In November of 2025, her track &quot;Don&#39;t Tell Me How To Rave&quot; was the #1 trending song in the United States in all genres on SoundCloud, and was the subject of a billboard campaign in Times Square. She was also featured as one of Beatport&#39;s &quot;On Our Radar&quot; artists for August 2025. Her tracks have seen support from David Guetta, John Summit, Patrick Topping, FISHER, Solomun, AC Slater, Green Velvet, Jamie Jones, Marco Carola, and many more across both the EDM and tech house worlds. She has performed at EDC Las Vegas, the DoLab stage at Coachella, Zamna Festival and Splash House, and has provided direct support for Kyle Watson, Noizu and Diplo on tour. Casmalia&#39;s sound can be described as bass-heavy with detailed percussion and can range in style from minimal to melodic.</p>
