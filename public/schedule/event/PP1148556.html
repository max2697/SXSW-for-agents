  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Beyoncé did it. Kendrick did it. Taylor did it. Now it’s your turn. This immersive workshop (with a killer soundtrack) turns rejection, rivalry, and resentment into creative fire. From The Count of Monte Cristo to Kill Bill, we’ll channel iconic revenge arcs, neuroscience insights, and pop power plays. In doing so, we&#39;ll reframe past slights as story fuel, sharpen your personal or professional brand, and turn petty into power moves. Part life strategy, part anti-hero training camp, this is your chance to alchemize grudge into growth. Who said motivation had to be pure?</p>
