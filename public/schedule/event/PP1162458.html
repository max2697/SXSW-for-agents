  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>From personalized supplement regimens to wearables and AI health tracking, consumers are building their own health ecosystems. This session explores how self-directed health has gone mainstream, transforming how we approach wellness, performance, and prevention. But as products and tools become more accessible, people face an overwhelming and opaque marketplace full of bold claims and conflicting advice. What does it mean to be a “biohacker” today, and how can we take charge of our health whilst also navigating a system that still struggles with transparency?</p>
