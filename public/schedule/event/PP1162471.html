  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Artificial intelligence is a highly disruptive technology that will challenge existing institutions in all industries and domains globally. Traditional approaches to creating value will become less and less effective as this technology spreads. On the other side, this technology opens up new potential to create exponentially expanding value but, to harness this potential, we need to become very creative in imagining and implementing new approaches to managing organizations.</p>
