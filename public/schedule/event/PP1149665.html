  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>“Inspiration is for amateurs. I’m a professional artist: I wake up every day and go to work.”

This is the mindset that transformed Daniel Arsham from a student scraping by in his Brooklyn studio into one of the most sought-after artists of his generation. In Future Relic, he breaks through the mystique of the art world and shows what it really takes to make it in any creative endeavor.  

He&#39;ll discuss the art of the grind: how to run a creative business and why surrounding yourself with ambitious, successful people is non-negotiable.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Daniel Arsham is an artist whose work blends sculpture, architecture, performance, and design into a singular vision shaped by time, memory, and material experimentation. His now-iconic “eroded” aesthetic—artifacts rendered as if excavated from the future—has become a signature visual language that speaks to impermanence, nostalgia, and transformation. Born in Cleveland and raised in Miami, Arsham became the youngest artist ever to work with legendary choreographer Merce Cunningham. His work is in the collections of the world&#39;s most acclaimed museums and he has collaborated with major brands from Dior to Adidas. He is the author of Future Relic: Failures, Disasters, Detours, and How I Made a Career as an Artist. &quot;,
