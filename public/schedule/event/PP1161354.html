  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The World Cup is the most-watched sporting event &amp; ultimate proving ground for brands ready to think beyond borders &amp; traditional playbooks. Yet, we persist in approaching this once-every-four-years opportunity with tired strategies. It&#39;s not about slapping logos on jerseys; it&#39;s about cultural fluency at scale. The next cycle brings unprecedented viewing fragmentation, creator-driven content &amp; fans expecting authentic engagement across 20+ markets simultaneously. ADWEEK&#39;s William Bradley and top CMOs explore how to revolutionize global sports marketing for the next World Cup.</p>
