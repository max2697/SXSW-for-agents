  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>For the past 10 years, Theo Lawrence has been making a name for himself as France&#39;s favorite songbird. A truly one-of-a-kind country singer and genuine keeper of the flame, Lawrence came into his own on his Austin-made 2023 LP release, Cherie, and on his all-acoustic album, Pickin&#39; &amp; Singin&#39;. His most recent release, a duet All Fifty States (with Melissa Carper), is a playful back-and-forth about two people in love who don’t always see eye to eye. It&#39;s a perfect showcase of storytelling, connection, and the artistry Theo brings to every song.

Lawrence pens classic love songs and delivers with a croon straight out of the Charlie Rich and Ray Price golden years. In recent years, he has played a pivotal role in reviving an interest for Country Music in Europe, and with his recent move to Austin, TX, Theo Lawrence is bringing his honed craft back to its American cradle.

Newly signed to Warner Records, we expect to hear Theo&#39;s name a lot more in the coming months and years.</p>
