  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>A thriving news industry is essential—not only to democracy, but also as a powerful platform for marketers and advertisers. Yet concerns about brand safety have caused many to retreat from news content, often based on outdated fears and misinformation. In an era of rapid technological disruption—including the rise of AI and increasing cultural polarization— this panel unites marketers and media experts to challenge assumptions and champion news. We&#39;ll explore how advertisers can re-engage with journalism in ways that uphold brand values, build consumer trust, and deliver real business results.</p>
