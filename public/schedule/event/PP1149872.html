  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The internet has gone quiet, at full volume. Public feeds are louder than ever, but the most meaningful conversations - and the real signals of what people actually care about - are now happening in private spaces. According to GIPHY&#39;s research, 90 percent of people share major life updates in group chats before they post them publicly. More than half of Gen Z says their chat knows them better than their family. And every day, 50 percent more GIFs are sent than voice memos. This talk goes inside the shift from public to private sharing, and what it means for brands, creators, and communicators.</p>
