  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Jeff Akoh is a Nigerian singer-songwriter whose soulful vocals and genre-blending sound sit at the crossroads of Afropop and R&amp;B. He rose to prominence as the youngest winner of MTN Project Fame West Africa, marking the beginning of a steadily evolving music career.

He has since released a growing body of work that has amassed millions of streams across digital platforms, anchored by his debut album Lokoja and a run of widely received singles. In 2025, Akoh released his latest EP, Rebel Heart, a project that reflects a more personal and boundary-pushing phase of his artistry.

Akoh has collaborated with a range of artists across genres, including Eric Bellinger, alongside other notable regional and international creatives, continuing to expand his sound and global reach.</p>
