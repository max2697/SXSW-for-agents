  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The road can be a tough place, and especially for young artists early in their careers. In 2025, the Country Music Association made a major investment to sustain industry-focused mental health organizations with Amber Health delivering those resources directly to emerging artists on the road. This panel shares the story behind that collaboration—how rising country star Wyatt Flores, his manager William Dyer, CMA’s Tiffany Kerns and Dr. Chayim Newman of Amber Health joined forces to reimagine tour support and pioneer a new, replicable model for artist care in country music.</p>
