  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Born amidst the cultural vibrancy of Glasgow and Paris, YES AND MAYBE is an electrifying two-piece band that pushes the boundaries of contemporary music. 
 
The first band member, a multi-instrumentalist and writer, excels in crafting minimalist guitar-based melodies, demonstrating a perfect blend of ingenuity and precision. His obsessive self-criticism and penchant for perfection have allowed him to transform his influences into his own unique sound.
 
The second member, a performer, writer, and producer, brings his experiences and emotions to life through introspective lyrics paired with evocative, ethereal vocals. His artistry lies in balancing deeply metaphorical, grounded lyrics with melodies that evoke a sense of escapism. This potent mix of realism and fantasy forms an integral part of YES AND MAYBE&#39;s distinctive sound.
​
Their songwriting process, both organic and instinctive, evolves from a simple phrase or a recorded sound into a comprehensive musical piece within a day. Their songs encapsulate their raw emotions, serving as a beacon of authenticity in an industry often mired in overproduction.
 
YES AND MAYBE, though relatively new, brings a refreshing spontaneity and a shared vision to redefine the musical landscape. Their commitment to creating music that resonates with their listeners&#39; shared experiences makes them a band worth investing in. Keep an eye on this Glasgow based duo—they&#39;re a unique proposition with a future as innovative as their sound.</p>
