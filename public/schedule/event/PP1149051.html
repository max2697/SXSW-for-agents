  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The economic model that has funded the Internet for three decades is breaking. AI systems now provide answers directly instead of sending users to websites, and AI agents are beginning to handle transactions without people ever visiting a site. Content creators are losing traffic and revenue, and nobody has figured out what replaces it.

As CEO and co-founder of Cloudflare, Matthew Prince has a unique view of how the web is changing and what comes next, handling 20% of all Internet traffic. This session will examine the post-search Internet and the profound shift in power. We’ll dive into how AI agents are changing commerce, who truly controls information access, and the looming question of who gets paid for content. The choices we make now regarding compensation, ownership, and digital access will determine the web&#39;s future trajectory.</p>
