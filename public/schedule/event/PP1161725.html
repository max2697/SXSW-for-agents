  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>This fireside chat will include a discussion of two new approaches that challenge status quo organization and leadership practices in higher education. Namely, staff, faculty, and leaders are invited to engage in systemic and structural changes aligned with liberation praxis and the ethics of care. Drawing from organizational theories, the social sciences, research, and lived experience, the discussants will challenge each other and the audience to imagine the personal and institutional changes required to promote employee well-being and creativity in today’s higher education workplace.</p>
