  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Chicago-born and Atlanta-raised, Raq Baby is carving out his own lane in hip-hop with an unapologetic sound that blends raw street emotion with melodic vulnerability. His music captures the highs and lows of his come-up — gritty, honest, and charged with energy that connects instantly with the youth of his generation. Raq continues to captivate his audience with is newest project I Never Gave AF, a bold statement of self-determination that earned him a placement on local playlists and music blogs across the South. His sound fuses the unfiltered storytelling of classic trap with drill rap — creating music that hits hard both in the club and through headphones. On stage, Raq’s presence is magnetic. He’s performed alongside artists like SahBabii, YTB Fatt, Hunxho, and Vonoff1700, bringing an unmatched energy that’s helped him sell out his first headline show at Atlanta’s Aisle 5 and secure bookings at Rolling Loud. Beyond the music, Raq Baby stands as a voice for authenticity — a young artist who’s seen struggle, growth, and triumph, and channels all of it into his art. Raq Baby is more than an artist — he’s a movement in the making.</p>
