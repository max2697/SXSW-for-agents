  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>True Jackson is an independent artist who blends 90s grunge rock production with an anthemic pop vocal. A native of Los Angeles, True has been embraced by the vibrant New York music scene, having performed at such legendary venues as the Mercury Lounge, Baby’s All Right, and Le Poisson Rouge, to name a few. 
True channels her emotions into catchy hooks and electrifying guitar riffs, painting a clear picture of where she has been and where she’s going with her debut song: “Paint Me”, released in 2024 and featured in the American High film, &#39;Prom Dates&#39;, streaming on Hulu. 
True’s debut EP, RIP TRUE, was released in 2025 and features standouts “Smooth Talking” and “Bad”.  Making music for the crashout girlies, these 4 songs encapsulate struggling with self-doubt and navigating out of her youth into her 20’s, allowing the audience to scream and dance through life, embracing the imperfections instead of sitting in it.
Her follow-up project explores a toxic relationship and how the heroine ultimately regains her power. The project will be released in Spring 2026 with two lead singles coming just before she takes Austin, TX by storm as part of this year’s South by Southwest Festival.</p>
