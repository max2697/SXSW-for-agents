  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As digital immediacy accelerates creative output and reshapes our ideas of design quality, questions of intention and integrity are more urgent than ever. This session examines how print media—with its deliberate design and intentional editorial standards—offers a model for clearer communication and higher-quality work. We’ll explore how analog formats encourage depth, accountability, and thoughtful creativity in an era obsessed with speed.</p>
