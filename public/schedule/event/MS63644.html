  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Rosegarden Funeral Party has made a strong mark on the international post punk and goth scene since the release of their debut EP The Chopping Block in 2018. Since then, the band has released the EP At the Stake in 2020 and three full length albums: Martyr in 2019, In the Wake of Fire in 2021, and From the Ashes in 2024. Their work has earned critical acclaim from outlets including Post Punk, LA Weekly, SF Sonic, and the Dallas Observer.

The band has toured extensively across the United States as both a headliner and support act, completing over thirteen tours. In 2023, Rosegarden Funeral Party made their UK and European debut with performances in Italy, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Scotland, England, and Germany. Highlights included headlining Beautiful Noise Festival and supporting Skeletal Family and Corpus Delicti at Wave Gotik Treffen in Leipzig.

Blending classic gothic sounds with modern pop sensibility, Rosegarden Funeral Party delivers emotionally resonant lyrics centered on heartbreak, healing, and self love. Their message of kindness and connection has helped cultivate a devoted and steadily growing global fanbase.</p>
