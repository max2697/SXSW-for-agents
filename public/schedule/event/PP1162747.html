  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>In the US and globally, civil society is facing existential challenges due to significant funding shortfalls resulting from cuts by the US and other traditional donors. For many nonprofits, this has meant imposing program cuts and layoffs, jeopardizing their ability to deliver on their missions sustainably.
We plan to discuss the following challenges (or “snakes” according to Indigenous prophecy) undermining digital rights and how to overcome them: the shrinking of resources, the increasing power of Big Tech, data colonialism, the rise of war crimes, and energy-demanding technologies.</p>
