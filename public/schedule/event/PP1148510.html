  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Join renowned investor and philanthropist Mohnish Pabrai for a thought-provoking talk on the key mental models that have shaped major decisions in his life, from business and investing to philanthropy and personal growth. An avid follower of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, Pabrai has long embraced Munger’s call to develop a “latticework of mental models,” a multidisciplinary toolkit for thinking clearly and avoiding misjudgment. In this session, he will go beyond simply restating the classics. Instead, he will highlight the select models he has found most indispensable, the ones that have guided him in navigating uncertainty, spotting opportunities, and sidestepping avoidable errors. Pabrai will introduce new mental models of his own, distilled from decades of experience, hard lessons, and reflection. These additions help bring to light patterns of behavior and decision-making that he believes are critical for anyone seeking not just financial success, but a truly fulfilling life.</p>
