  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Growing up on her family&#39;s farm in Mount Russell, regional Australia, Melanie Dyer started crafting her stories into songs at the age of twelve. With an authentic blend of her down-to-earth farm girl roots, dynamic stage presence and catchy contemporary songwriting chops, Melanie has performed at some of the world&#39;s biggest country festivals, including CMA Fest in Nashville, CMC Rocks, and the Big Red Bash in Australia. As a talented artist and songwriter, Melanie has racked up multiple #1 country radio hits and earned three nominations for Most Performed Country Work at the APRA Awards. 
With over 12.5 million streams, her chart-topping albums Fresh and Between You and Me have garnered her prestigious Golden Guitar nominations and the coveted APRA Professional Development Award. Her breakout hit Memphis T-Shirt catapulted her into the mainstream spotlight on commercial radio networks and a remarkable six-week stint at number one on the Australian Country Hot 50 Chart. In 2025 Melanie relocated to Nashville, Tennessee to chase her dreams of building a global audience and sharing her music across the USA.</p>
