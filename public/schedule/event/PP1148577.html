      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Dr. Elizabeth Gray serves as Audubon’s CEO, leading the organization toward its vision of a future where birds thrive. A champion of science-based conservation and a renowned expert in global conservation and climate change, she joined Audubon in March 2021 as President and Chief Conservation Officer and was named CEO later that year—the first woman since Audubon’s founding in 1905 to hold the role. She leads more than 800 staff working across the Americas to alter the course of climate change and habitat loss. Since her arrival, she has led a landmark $826 million campaign, the groundbreaking release of the Migratory Bird Explorer, and the unifying Flight Plan strategy, reinforcing Audubon’s commitment to hemispheric conservation through the power of birds.  Prior to Audubon, she most recently served as Global Managing Director of The Nature Conservancy’s (TNC) Climate Change program. She holds a PhD in ecology from the University of Washington and an AB with highest honors in psychology from Harvard University.&quot;,
