    &quot;company_bio&quot;: &quot;Discovr is an artist-focused service that lets musicians and songwriters have their music played on radio station streams, alongside broadcast programming. Artists, labels, managers, and distributors can use Discovr to upload tracks and have them inserted into radio streams – in place of ad interruptions – through faidr, a radio streaming app. Once a track has been approved, Discovr customers can monitor listener engagement and behavior through a robust analytics dashboard.\n\n\n\n&quot;,
