  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>If you ask someone their favorite version of The Great Gatsby, they might say Leonardo DiCaprio as few know there was a 1926 version that no longer exists. This session dives into how archives and AI are transforming how we preserve, discover, and give new life to forgotten film history. With insights from expert film archivists from leading production companies , we&#39;ll explore how AI-powered metadata tools are modernizing cultural preservation, making once-lost footage more accessible for creators and audiences alike.</p>
