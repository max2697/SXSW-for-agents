  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Large language models scoop up news for training and live chatbots, but rarely pay a dime. Will they eventually put journalism out of business by self-generating “news” content or regurgitating data collected from gadgets and glasses? With trust and value in news plummeting, perhaps journalism’s role as a watchdog, forum for social exchange, and spark for civic engagement is already defunct. Or does original, ethical reporting offer something special? In this provocative session, experts in AI ethics, journalism and global trends share divergent views on the future of journalism.</p>
