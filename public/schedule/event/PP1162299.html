  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Scamming is a multibillion-dollar, transnational business rivaling legitimate enterprises.  In actual offices, their workers labor leg to leg at long tables -- cubicles would actually be more humane. Scams are now a way for nation-states to steal the wealth of Americans, at speed and scale. These criminals are on a rampage, and those in power, in the US and abroad, aren&#39;t really focused on stopping it. Hear from a former prosecutor hell-bent on disrupting this prolific crime, an expert in deception, and a scam survivor and podcaster about how we can all fight back.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Tyson is a San Francisco-based author, speaker, and victims’ rights advocate who has dedicated his post-tech career to raising awareness about con artists and financial predators. Once a successful professional in the tech industry, Tyson’s life took an unexpected turn when he became entangled in a high-profile fraud and murder case that would later become the subject of the Warner Brothers true crime podcast American Hustlers, based on the book Until Someone Gets Hurt, which he co-authored. Tyson uses his personal experience to help others recognize and navigate the emotional and financial devastation that scams can cause. When he’s not advocating for victims’ rights, he enjoys traveling with his husband, contributing to political discussions, and finding humor in life’s darker corners.\n&quot;,
