  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Daily, we wake to the unimaginable becoming reality: the highest temperatures in recorded history, technology acquiring human-like communication capabilities, realignment of global alliances and ideologies. Such times of upheaval are opportunities to reinvent the institutions, ways of thinking, and modes of doing. Sociologist John Fabian Witt said, these are “occasions in which people remake the world.” In this conversation, experts with decades of experience in future-facing strategies, will share foresight techniques for imagining radically different futures and detecting signals of reinvention and scholarship on how communities depicted as under-resourced create practices and institutions of their own—as examples for building more just and equitable futures.</p>

Marina’s current research focuses on transformations in the world of work and new forms of value creation. Marina&#39;s book, The Nature of the Future: Dispatches from the Socialstructed World, explores many of these themes and draws connections between the changes in our technology infrastructure and our organizational landscape, from education to governance and health.&quot;,

Winn is the Excellence in Learning Graduate School of Education Professor and Faculty Director of the Stanford Accelerator for Learning&#39;s Equity in Learning Initiative. She is the Principal Investigator for the Futuring for Equity Lab. Her scholarship examines how non-dominant youth and communities have developed literate trajectories across a range of historical and contemporary settings within and outside formal schooling. She seeks to understand how communities that have been depicted as under resourced create practices, processes, and institutions of their own—and what we can learn from those examples to build more just, more collaborative, and more equitable futures. An ethnographer by training, Dr. Winn also engages in historical research focused on social movements in education.&quot;,
