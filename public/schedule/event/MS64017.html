  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Alex Cano is a nationally touring Rock/Americana artist hailing from New York’s Hudson Valley. Known for his rich baritone and soaring, gritty rock vocals, Cano’s sound lives at the crossroads of high octane, blues driven rock ’n’ roll and vulnerable Americana balladry. His debut album, Every Rise of the Sun, is a raw chronicle of resilience and survival—equal parts cathartic release and anthemic triumph. Praised by outlets including Paste Magazine and Indie Current for its authenticity and emotional weight, the record established Cano as a voice unafraid to merge heartfelt intimacy with road-tested rock energy. Cano has toured across the US, performing everything from intimate listening rooms to major festivals. He has shared the stage with artists such as Plain White T&#39;s, Gin Blossoms, Tyler Bryant and the Shakedown, Band of Heathens, and Chris Barron. Along the way, he’s built a grassroots fanbase bound by a sense of community, connection, and resilience, values that run through all of his work. With a career already marked by resilience, authenticity, and growth, Alex Cano continues to carve his place as one of the most compelling voices in modern Rock/Americana.</p>
