      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Walter is the composer of the Intel sonic logo and one of the early leaders in the field of audio branding. Originally from Vienna, he studied classical guitar and electronic music before moving to Los Angeles, where he founded Musikvergnuegen, a studio that created sound identities for global brands and film projects. His work eventually led him to explore how music could be used beyond entertainment — specifically in health and neuroscience — which inspired him to launch HealthTunes, a nonprofit that pairs music and sound with evidence-based wellness practices. He now divides his time between creative projects in Los Angeles and Vienna, where he also teaches and continues to develop new ideas at the intersection of art, technology, and healing.&quot;,
