  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Responsible AI isn’t a buzzword—it’s a daily practice that drives the appropriate level of trust, mitigates risk, and powers better business outcomes. But what does it look like in product and design? It’s a practical, human-centered approach to designing AI systems that are safe, equitable, and effective. In this session, RAI leaders from Microsoft, SAP, Adobe, and JPMorgan Chase share real tools, UX strategies, and lessons from the trenches. Gain an understanding of RAI - and walk away with actionable best practices to apply now, whether you&#39;re leading solo or scaling across an enterprise.</p>
