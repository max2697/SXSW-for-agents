  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Every brand has a scent, whether designed or not. Now, brand leaders can control it. This panel explores the frontier of scent branding and the new AI-powered technology that enables it. With the development of olfactory intelligence (OI), brands can harness our most powerful sense, capturing consumers’ memories and influencing their associations. Hear from Generation by Osmo’s Founder and Master Perfumer on how OI has made fragrance accessible for brands and creators of all sizes, and from brand leaders harnessing its power to develop signature scents, including the Museum of Pop Culture.</p>
