  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>At 20, Texas-based artist Lola Kinsey is stepping fully into her own, blending classic rock roots with a modern pop shimmer. Her debut EP Come of Age captures the messy in-between of growing up. Heartbreak, family tension, and the pressure of figuring out who you’re supposed to be versus who you actually are.

Inspired by icons like Stevie Nicks, Cher, and Linda Ronstadt, Lola builds songs around strong melodies, big feelings, and a genre-bending spirit that feels both timeless and current. Ask her what genre she makes and she’ll still say “Linda Ronstadt,” a wink to her love of fearless storytelling and emotional honesty.

Momentum continues to build: three tracks from her debut EP Come of Age have received radio play on KXT and 88.1 Indie, and she appeared as an official SXSW 2025 showcase artist. With a return to SXSW and a Jambaloo appearance in 2026, plus her debut album slated for release this year, Lola is ready to take over the world one disco at a time.</p>
