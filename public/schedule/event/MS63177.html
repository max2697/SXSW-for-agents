  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>A longtime favorite of New York City’s Americana scene, Emily Frembgen returns to SXSW for her third consecutive year as an official artist at Don Giovanni Records. 

“Fentanyl,” the first single off Frembgen’s album No Hard Feelings released under Don Giovanni, was hailed by Glide Magazine as “brimming with sharp and twangy guitar and vocals that bring to mind the likes of Lucinda Williams, Laura Cantrell, and Amy Rigby.”

Frembgen spent her childhood bouncing between Colorado and Baltimore, then finally to New York City in 2000. She was shaped musically by both the grittiness of city and by Americana heroes like Kathleen Edwards and Alejandro Escovedo. 

In 2021 Frembgen released her debut studio album with producer Hugh Pool at Excello Studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in 2021. Irreverently titled It’s Me or the Dog, it garnered widespread critical praise, with New York Music Daily naming it “one of the best records of the year” and Glide Magazine calling it “a strong study in writing both melodies and powerful lyrics.”

Her next full length album, Little Stranger, is due out in 2026.</p>
