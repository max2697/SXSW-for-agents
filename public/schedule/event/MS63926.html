  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>amri fuses her Indian roots into putting a spin on her much-loved Soul and R&amp;B to create a fresh, new, jazzy, colourful sound. Branching into a range of sounds built in Carnatic melodies, amri balances relatable lyrics to a fun, fresh groove. Born and primarily brought up in London alongside Guernsey, she draws from these experiences in her writing. With so many inspirations she branches from, her soulful, sweet melodies will surely hold a piece of something you love and play over in your head! 

She touches on her exposure in the world as a young woman of colour, translating this into getting you to feel, sing and move with her. Her debut EP ‘grooves in a SMILE’ invites you into her world to feel, sing and move with her. Having been interviewed on BBC Bristol’s Breakfast show, songs featured on BBC Introducing Radio and showcased in RESONATE and KICKDRUM magazines, amri has been gaining attention, and seems not to be slowing down.
Now based in Bristol with her band, her blend of the smooth, sultry edges of jazz and soul, combined with brass and sitar, creates a unique fusion that’s not one to miss..</p>
