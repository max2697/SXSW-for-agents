  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Corporations are weaponizing your personal data to inflate prices, suppress wages, and undermine transparency and basic fairness. This panel will expose how a convergence of corporate power and new technology has created a dizzying array of deceptive pricing practices. From surveillance pricing on airfares to algorithmic price fixing by landlords, companies are leveraging troves of consumer data to rip off customers. Our panelists will share how they have successfully defeated some of these nefarious practices and what policymakers, regulators, and consumers can do to fight back.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Alvaro Bedoya is a Senior Advisor at the American Economic Liberties Project. He was appointed by President Joe Biden to serve as a Commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission in May 2022 and served in that role until his resignation in June 2025. At the FTC, Commissioner Bedoya focused on how antitrust law could do more to protect workers and labor unions and warned against rapidly advancing workplace surveillance technology. He took a special interest in the challenges facing small-town grocers and pharmacists and helped coordinate the Commission’s revival of the Robinson-Patman Act, a long-dormant antitrust law that was passed to give small sellers a level playing field against retail giants. He is a graduate of Harvard College and Yale Law School.&quot;,
