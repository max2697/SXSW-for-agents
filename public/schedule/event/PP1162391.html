  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>AI adoption is growing, but cloud-based AI is hitting limits like high costs, privacy concerns, environmental damage, &amp; latency issues. This session will explore why the next generation of AI will be specialized, expert, &amp; local. Panelists will unpack how on-device AI can deliver improved performance, privacy, &amp; scalability with a more sustainable infrastructure. They’ll share how local AI is changing businesses, reshaping privacy expectations, and shifting the global tech landscape - and the next steps the industry has to take to make the use of local AI widespread.</p>
