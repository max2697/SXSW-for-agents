  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Bland is forgettable—and in today&#39;s content-saturated world, forgettable is fatal. This session explores how emotionally evocative, creatively risky campaigns like Life360’s “I Think of You Dying”—which tapped into the quiet fear every parent holds—confront the gap between what people truly feel and what brands are willing to say. Hear from creative leaders who are leaning into discomfort to reflect human truths and challenge taboos. The conversation will explore boundaries, backlash, and how pushing limits can drive impact when rooted in authenticity and deep audience understanding.</p>
