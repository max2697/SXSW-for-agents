      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;As Executive Chairman of Barry’s, Joey Gonzalez has spent his career redefining the way people move and connect through fitness. A visionary entrepreneur expert at building and scaling brands that make people feel connected, Gonzalez leads with purpose shaped by his roots as the son of a Cuban refugee and a proud gay parent.\nOver the past two decades, Gonzalez has been instrumental in scaling Barry’s from a beloved local studio into a global fitness phenomenon spanning 16 countries across the North America, Europe, Mexico, Australia, and Southeast Asia.\nUnder his leadership, Barry’s navigated unprecedented growth and survived massive challenges such as the global pandemic which shuttered studios worldwide. Through it all, Gonzalez spearheaded bold innovation - launching outdoor studios, expanding into digital with Barry’s X, and introducing the company’s first-ever loyalty program. His decisive leadership during this time distinguished Barry’s within the industry and was chronicled in a 2021 Harvard Business School case study.\n\nGonzalez’s achievements have earned widespread recognition. He was named to Fast Company’s “Most Creative People in Business” list (2018), received the CEO of the Year Award from North Castle Partners (2018), was honored as EY’s Greater Los Angeles Entrepreneur of the Year (2020), and received StartOut’s Leadership Award (2022). Most recently, he completed the OPM Program at Harvard Business School.&quot;,
