  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The website is dying. The mouse is next. In this bold fireside chat, Alex Hamilton and Suff Syed challenge everything we know about digital experience. From liquid brands that move across surfaces to voice interfaces that erase traditional UX, they’ll unpack what happens after design as we know it. What does it mean when a brand meets you, in your car, your watch, your fridge, your earbuds? What does design look like when it’s generated, optimised, and personalised in real time? Expect a thrilling look at the collapse of static web thinking.</p>
