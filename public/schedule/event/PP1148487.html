  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Are You Ready to Scale Sales? How Fast?
These two questions are mission-critical to the success of any startup, product launch, or market expansion. Yet, too often we rely on gut feel—or let irrelevant signals like a recent fundraise or comparisons to past unicorns— to drive our decisions.
The Science of Scaling offers a rigorous framework for founders, executives, and investors to calculate the answers using their company’s actual performance data—not wishful thinking.
Drawing on insights from hundreds of startups over the past 25 years, Mark Roberge—Founding CRO at HubSpot, Senior Lecturer at Harvard Business School, and Co-Founder of Stage 2 Capital—reveals the five most common reasons revenue acceleration efforts fail.
Whether you&#39;re a founder starting to scale, an investor guiding your portfolio, or a GM launching a new product, The Science of Scaling framework is your operating manual.
Don’t guess. Don’t gamble. Scale scientifically.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Mark Roberge is an entrepreneur, investor, and educator dedicated to helping startups and growth-stage companies scale with precision. As the fourth employee and Founding Chief Revenue Officer at HubSpot, he built and scaled the go-to-market organization from zero revenue to a successful IPO, pioneering a data-driven, buyer-centric sales model that has since influenced go-to-market teams worldwide.\r\rAfter HubSpot’s IPO, Mark joined the full-time teaching faculty at Harvard Business School, where he designed and taught courses on sales, marketing, and entrepreneurship, mentoring hundreds of student entrepreneurs and immersing himself in the challenges of early-stage growth. \r\rMore recently, Mark co-founded Stage 2 Capital, the first venture fund backed by over 1,000 elite sales and marketing executives. Stage 2 has invested in over 100 startups, connecting founders with proven revenue growth frameworks and seasoned go-to-market leaders to accelerate their scaling journey.\r\rA sought-after speaker, Mark has shared his insights at major conferences including SaaStr, South by Southwest, Inbound, and the World Business Forum, and guest lectured at leading institutions such as MIT, Stanford, and Harvard.\r\rMark holds an MBA from the MIT Sloan School of Management and an undergraduate engineering degree from Lehigh University. He is also the author of the bestselling book The Sales Acceleration Formula and now The Science of Scaling, which distills decades of experience into a practical, data-driven roadmap for founders, executives, and investors striving to achieve sustainable, scalable growth.&quot;,
