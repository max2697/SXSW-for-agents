  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>When Mahmoud Khalil was targeted and nearly deported by the Trump administration for his advocacy, his life as a Palestinian student and soon-to-be father were irrevocably upended. Now released from detention – but still facing the threat of deportation – Khalil joins The Guardian for an unflinching conversation on his ordeal, the system that tried to silence him, and the personal and political stakes of resistance. 

*Mahmoud Khalil will be participating in this session virtually</p>

He has previously worked in development and international affairs with the United Nations, the British government, as well as other non-profit organizations in the Middle East. Khalil played a key role in Columbia’s student movement opposing Israel’s war on Gaza. In March 2025, the Trump administration unlawfully arrested Khalil, transported him thousands of miles away to an ICE detention center in Louisiana, and attempted to deport him — all in retaliation for his advocacy in support of Palestinian rights. After 104 days in detention, a federal court ordered his release.&quot;,
