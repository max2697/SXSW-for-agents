  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>This session is for professionals who are ready to go beyond the traditional 9–5 and explore what&#39;s possible as a creator, founder, or thought leader—especially on LinkedIn. Whether you&#39;re side-hustling, recently laid off, building a business, or simply curious about showing up more intentionally online, this session will help you take the next step with confidence.
LinkedIn is where the creator economy meets real opportunity.
Join us in Austin to connect with fellow creators, exchange strategies, and build relationships that elevate your presence—online and off.</p>
