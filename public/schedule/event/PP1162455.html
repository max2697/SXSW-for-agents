As\rhead of all marketing for Nederlander Concerts, she is responsible for the online\rdevelopment, marketing initiatives and promotional campaigns for Nederlander’s\raward-winning venues and its bookings at third party facilities across the country.\rWith more than 35 years of local, regional and national experience, Jamie is well\rknown for her ability to create innovative strategies and tour marketing campaigns,\rwhich integrate traditional and new media technologies resulting in a deeper\rconnection between artists, their fans and ticket sales. Her foresight has enabled\rNederlander to be an early adopter of technologies like Bandsintown and\rTicketsell.ai, and work on experimental projects with Google’s Area 120.\rIn 2020, Loeb started volunteering for NIVA (National Independent Venue Association),\ran organization made up of independent venue, promoters and festivals. She played a\rkey role in a number of projects for NIVA, including the #SOSFEST – a three-day virtual\rfestival which raised over $3 million for the NIVA Emergency Relief Fund. Loeb’s and\rthe NIVA team’s efforts lead to Congress passing SVOG (Shuttered Venue Operators\rGrant), creating a $16 billion grant program to save independent venues, promoters\rand festivals from permanently closing. Loeb now serves as a NIVA Board Member. As\rProgramming Chair, Loeb programmed the 2024 NIVA conference in New Orleans and\rwill be programming the 2025 conference in Milwaukee.\rPrior to Nederlander, Jamie was the Senior Director of National Tour Marketing for\rLive Nation where she developed national tour marketing plans for Def Leppard, Avril\rLavigne, Projekt Revolution and more.
