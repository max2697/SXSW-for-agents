  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>“Music will never stop evolving, and I will continue to grow with it.” ~Oscar Ortiz

Born into an artistic family of Regional Mexican artists, Oscar Ortiz is the youngest of four leading artists in the genre: Gerardo, William, and Kevin Ortiz. However, Oscar shines on his own with his youthful style and talent as a composer, fusing cumbia and ballads with modern corridos.

His solo music began to transcend borders with the singles “El Del C8” (2023) and “FIRST LOVE” (2024) with Edgardo Núñez; the latter catapulting him onto the global scene with over 200 million streams on Spotify, a No. 1 spot on Billboard Regional Mexican Airplay, platinum certifications, and virality on TikTok.
This phenomenon was followed by other songs that consolidated his musical identity, such as &quot;ALVRGZO&quot; (with Alex Favela and Código FN), &quot;Anillos&quot; (with Oscar Maydón), &quot;Modo Bélico&quot; (with Polo González), &quot;23/7,&quot; and &quot;Ice Cream&quot; (with Los Mismos de la M).

Oscar Ortiz didn&#39;t stop there. In 2025, he continued to reap hits like &quot;Y Si Te Vas,&quot; a single released with Carin León, which peaked at #5 and is currently #7 on Billboard&#39;s Regional Mexican Airplay charts. Additionally, he has other songs released this year, such as “Aplauso” with Matisse, “AMIGOS PARA QUÉ”, “CARO,” and soon “LAST KISS” which will be released in October 2025. Added to this is his biggest project to date: his first studio album, projected to be released in January 2026. In Oscar&#39;s words, this project brings “a lot of love and heartbreak… corridos, versatile sounds, a little bit of everything,” in addition to collaborations with artists from different regional currents.</p>
