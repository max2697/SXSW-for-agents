  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Too often, AI feels like something that’s done to us, not with us or for us. It will affect every aspect of our lives. But AI is neither poison nor panacea. It is and will be what we make it. Now is the moment to shape the future of AI for people. This panel will explore how we build the ecosystem and infrastructure to ensure that people will benefit the most from AI. Experts in AI, philanthropy, and advocacy, will offer a new way of thinking about AI that moves from Silicon Valley’s mantra of “move fast and break things” to an alternative vision that centers our humanity.</p>
