  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>In an industry historically shaped by hierarchy and fear-based leadership, a new generation of executives is proving that true influence comes from empowerment, inclusion, and collective accountability. This high-level panel brings together senior leaders from across the music industry to explore how shifting from “I” to “we,” is not only transforming workplace culture - it’s building stronger creative output. Through real stories, we’ll examine how valuing every voice - whether front-facing or behind the scenes - is essential to creating the future of our industry.</p>
