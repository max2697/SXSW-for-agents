  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Across boardrooms, courtrooms, and communities, a growing wave of men are standing up for reproductive rights and changing conversations around abortion and maternal health. In this session, men across law, business and health advocacy explain why they’ve turned their platforms, personal stories and convictions into action. From expanding access to care, to shifting workplace culture, to fighting for safer childbirth, they actively participate in the movement for health, equity and freedom. With clarity, urgency and humor, this conversation calls in male audiences, giving them ways to show up.</p>
