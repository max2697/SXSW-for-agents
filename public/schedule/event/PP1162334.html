  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Across the country, platforms like Meta and the NYC MTA are blocking ads and posts that mention vaginal health, fertility or menopause— censoring essential medical terms and allowing misinformation to spread. In this panel, brand leaders and marketers will explore how censorship is shaping the way women’s health is discussed— or not discussed— in public spaces, and how companies are navigating censorship challenges. It will examine why naming matters and how bold, stigma-breaking messaging can educate, empower, and shift the narrative.</p>
