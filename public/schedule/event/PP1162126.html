  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>What happens when an academic&#39;s vision for transforming higher education meets building an actual university? This session explores the journey from Alternative Universities&#39; theoretical framework to building a new university in 2026 that is debt-free and apprenticeship-based. We examine the &quot;ROTC for private sector&quot; funding approach that shifts costs from students to employers, polymathic curriculum combining three non-adjacent majors, and navigating 2026&#39;s unique obstacles like accreditation and funding while leveraging opportunities from starting without entrenched bureaucracy.</p>
