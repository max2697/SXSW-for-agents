  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>KOJ is the sound of defiance rising from Liverpool, UK: a working-class voice turned outward, loud enough to cut through the noise, resilient enough to remain unshaken, and connected enough to represent a frustrated generation.

Drawing from the raw British sub-cultural sounds of Grime, Rap and Punk, KOJ creates music that confronts power while rooted in relatability and everyday struggle. Revolutionary in spirit yet populist in appeal, his music is built to connect, move, and be felt collectively. At its core is courage - raw, direct lyricism exploring survival and defiance, darkness and light, pressure and pride.

KOJ showcased his lyrical authority on his acclaimed debut EP Villain With A Conscience, earning support from Clash, Wonderland, The Face, Apple Music and Amazon Music.
Live is where KOJ reaches another level. He doesn’t perform - he leads. From Boomtown to Radio 1 Big Weekend, Reeperbahn and SXSW, his shows become charged, communal moments where tension turns to release.

More than a catalogue, KOJ is building a movement through purpose-driven visuals, tech-led collaborations and his growing TRiBE community — “a man on a mission,” as The F-Word Magazine puts it.</p>
