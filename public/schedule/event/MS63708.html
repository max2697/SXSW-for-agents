  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Big Fat Head is a byproduct of 21st century indulgence and a band consumed by sin. Based in Columbus, Ohio, this five-piece rock outfit has been categorized as “post-post-post punk” and “skuzz rock” by fans and enemies alike. First conceived by frontman Nate Wilder during a weekend visit in jail, a consistent live band was ultimately formed with partner Olivia Stefanoff and close friends Jordan Latas, Stanic Russ, and Felicity Gunn in the aftermath of Covid. Since 2021, Big Fat Head has maintained loyalty to their homegrown tape label and oft slept-on Ohio rock scene, self-released over 40 songs, played nearly 200 shows, with over 75 out of town. While sharing a scene in the shadow of Ohio legends like Devo, Breeders, Times New Viking, etc. with bands like Golomb, Villagerrr, Winston Hightower, DANA, &amp; countless others, Big Fat Head carved their own niche-within-a-niche and found opportunities opening for national acts such as Being Dead, TAGABOW, Sweeping Promises, Wishy, Bnny, GOON, Speedy Ortiz, Lewsberg, &amp; more. With two finished albums in their back pocket and no outside support to date, Big Fat Head embarks to Austin, Texas looking for love with their hearts on their sleeves.</p>
