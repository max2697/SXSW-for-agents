  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>AI is transforming marketing careers, not just the work itself. According to the 2025 CMO Survey, 17.2% of marketing efforts now involve AI and machine learning, with that share expected to reach 44.2% within three years. Traditional career paths are shifting, especially in fast-moving areas like advertising and branding, and hybrid roles like strategist plus prompt engineer are becoming the new norm. This panel dives into how to adapt, build in-demand skills, and navigate a career path that looks very different from even five years ago.</p>
