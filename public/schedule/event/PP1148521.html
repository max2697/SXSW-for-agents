      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Darnell Lamont Walker is a death doula, Emmy-nominated writer, and cultural anthropologist whose work lives at the intersection of grief, culture, and storytelling. His voice shows up in children’s television, writing for Karma’s World, Work It Out Wombats!, Blue’s Clues &amp;amp; You, and more, as well as in books and in the quiet, sacred rooms where people take their last breaths. Across the world, from Johannesburg and Saigon to London, Amsterdam, Ghana, and beyond, Darnell has helped individuals and communities find spaces where their stories could be shared safely and held with care. In his legacy work with dying clients, this often looks like preserving favorite recipes, ensuring that long after someone is gone, families can still gather, cook, eat, and remember the love that once lived at the table. His book, Never Can Say Goodbye (HarperOne), reflects on his journey as a death doula and the lessons learned from walking alongside the dying. At the heart of all his work is a simple mission: to help people tell the truth of their lives, tend to one another through transition, and leave behind something nourishing, whether that’s a story, a ritual, or a meal that keeps them close.&quot;,
