  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Your marketing dashboard is likely missing half the story. Impressions, clicks, and keyword rankings were built for a world where Google sent traffic to websites. When 60% of searches end in AI-generated answers without clicks, those metrics don&#39;t fully connect to revenue. AI traffic from platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity is already converting at 4-5x the rate of traditional search for some brands — but most marketing teams can&#39;t see it, let alone measure it.

This session introduces the measurement framework for AI-first marketing: answer share (how often you appear in AI responses), citation rate (how often you&#39;re referenced as a source), and AI-driven conversions (revenue from users who never clicked a traditional link). We&#39;ll discuss how to design attribution experiments that prove impact, connect your brand’s AI visibility to actual business outcomes, and build an executive dashboard that ties AI performance to revenue.</p>
