  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Startups are often pitched on “strategic partnerships” with large companies, but most never progress beyond a pilot. This panel features innovation leaders from a healthcare innovation and venture arm, a mobility and sustainability-focused enterprise, and a national restaurant brand redefining service through digital innovation. Together, they’ll unpack how corporates build new ventures, and what it takes for founders to gain traction and create lasting value with enterprise partners.</p>
