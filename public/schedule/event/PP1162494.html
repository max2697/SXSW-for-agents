  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Mainstream streaming focuses on personalized algorithms and passive listening. Meanwhile, some niche platforms embrace a participatory model where superfans don’t just consume music—they interact with it, shape it, and financially support creators in real time. These platforms embed tipping, live chat, and fan community engagement into the experience. This panel explores how fandom-driven models are redefining streaming and how “social radio” tech can help mainstream DSPs catch up. What if streaming became social, not solitary?</p>
