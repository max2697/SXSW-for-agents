  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>CorMae started as a social media ad and a dream and now has evolved into an up and coming punk and riot grrrl inspired band. The band started in February 2024, and has been steadily making its way into the Austin music scene ever since. Starting with a pop-forward garage rock EP, Cutie Core, released in April of 2025 and ending last year with a bang in October 2025 with the release of their more punk-forward EP “Hot Damn!” and an extra bonus punkified cover of Sheb Woolley’s “Purple People Eater,” CorMae are swiftly becoming an Austin Punk mainstay. The band are nominated by the Austin Chronicle for ATX’s 2025 Best Punk Band and you may also know them from opening shows for the likes of Of Montreal, Murder City Devils, and Pretty Girls Make Graves in 2025. CorMae’s songs are written about life, love, social, and economic struggles and their live show is aimed at commiserating on these issues with the audience. CorMae aims to build a community of friends and fans of all ages, creeds, races, and genders. After all, who doesn’t need a little cathartic shouting or a little dancing every once in a while?</p>
