  <p>The First Rule of NDAs - Don’t Talk About NDAs
How do you make a film about the weaponization of NDAs when people are prohibited from even admitting they signed one? This panel will examine how the film My NDA was made and how the filmmakers attempted to mitigate the risks faced by the film’s participants and the production itself. Panelists will discuss the thorny documentary ethics challenges that come into play when subjects are taking legal risks that could potentially lead to significant consequences. </p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Vincent P. White completed his undergraduate studies at Le Moyne College and Nagasaki Gaidai University, Japan.  He went on to receive his Juris Doctorate, under Dean’s Scholarship, from The Hofstra University School of Law with a concentration in Corporate and Securities Law. Vincent was admitted to the practice of law in New York State in 2009, and soon after was admitted to practice in both the Southern, Eastern and Northern Federal District Courts of New York. Following admission to the bar, Vincent worked at Leeds, Morelli and Brown P.C., a litigation-centric employment law practice where Vincent’s efforts lead to over $5,000,000.00 in verdicts and several hundred thousand dollars in settlements during his time with the firm. Vincent then transitioned to a role as Manners and Associates’ lead litigator and managing associate, helping to develop the firm beyond its corporate expertise to a full-service law firm capable of handling clients’ diverse employment litigation needs. Vincent has practiced before the Federal Courts including the Bankruptcy Courts, both Civil and Criminal State Courts, the New York State Court of Claims and the State’s Administrative Courts. In addition, Vincent has garnered settlements for his clients at mediations before the Equal Employment and Opportunities Commission and the New York State Division of Human Rights. As one of the founding members of NYC Job Attorney, Vincent’s efforts drove that firm to become the largest dedicated plaintiff-side employment firm in New York. From there, NYC Job Attorney has grown to practice in 22 States and has become a national law firm known as White &amp; Hilferty. Vincent additional acts as a panelist and arbitrator with the American Arbitration Association, hearing primarily matters in the field of employment law.&quot;,

Outside of work, Ifeoma loves time with her family on their hobby farm in New Mexico.
