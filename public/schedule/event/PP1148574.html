  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The mesopelagic zone, or Ocean Twilight Zone, where light begins to disappear, is home to creatures that are crucial to regulating our climate through the largest migration on the planet that locks away 2-6 gigatons of carbon every year. With improving technology and increasing demand for fish protein, industry is exploring ways to exploit these deep-sea animals for uses like fish oil and pet food. This session will showcase the amazing animals that live in the deep, their role in regulating our planet’s climate, and international efforts to keep this vital carbon pump functioning like it should.</p>
