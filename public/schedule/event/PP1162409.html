  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The recorded music industry is becoming more consolidated, with major labels acquiring independent music organizations at a faster clip, and the role of the independent sector is shifting as a result. UMG’s proposed acquisition of Downtown Music Holdings is just one example of this, though the trend has been increasing in recent years. In this changing landscape, what does independent music mean in 2026, and is it still important? What resources and strategies can independent artists use to build their careers as the industry continues to evolve?</p>
