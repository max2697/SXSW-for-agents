      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Graham is an NYC-based public relations, reputation management and communications consultant — empowered by 24+ years of experience advancing meaningful brand conversations. His roles have included brand manager, lead strategist, creative thought leader, mentor, fighter for inclusion and disruptor who’s willing to address what’s not working – so we can get to building what will work, now. He recently supported the global team at Wasserman, with strong focus on their Brands + Properties business, creative agency brand Laundry Service and women-focused expertise The Collective – including its academic Think Tank. Other current/recent clients include Ubisoft, Unsplash, Lupine Creative and more. \n\nAs a co-founder of Do the WeRQ, Graham helps tell the platform&#39;s story and connect the movement to partners who embrace the value of queer creativity. The mission of Do the WeRQ is simple: increase queer creativity, representation and share of voice in the advertising industry. The organization brings people across the industry together to foster connections, share experiences and collaborate on cultural transformations that support the LGBTQ+ community both in front of, and behind the scenes, 365-days-a-year. Because only when queer marketing talent is inspired, mobilized and celebrated – by brands and marketing leaders – will queer cultural creativity translate into meaningful business solutions. \n\nHis speaking appearances include placement on stages/platforms like SXSW, Advertising Week, Brand Innovators, the 3% Conference, Fishbowl Live, Unleashed LGBTQ+, New York Comic Con, The ANA Virtual Diversity Fair, and more. Graham also has experience as a stand-up comedian, writer and storyteller who has performed at Second City&#39;s Skybox Theater, the Gotham Comedy Club, UCBeast, The People&#39;s Improv Theater and more. &quot;,
