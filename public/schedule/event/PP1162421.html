  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As technology has evolved—from mass media to digital to social—brands have developed new abilities to interact with humans. The real transformation that brands undergo with AI won&#39;t be just about efficiency, but rather about showing up in the world in new ways that are adaptive, contextually aware, and authentic. Through recent case studies from Google, we&#39;ll explore how brands are embedding human creativity into AI systems to enable entirely new forms of human-brand interaction—and why this shift demands a fundamentally different approach to creativity.</p>
