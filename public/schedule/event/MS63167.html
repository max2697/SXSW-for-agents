  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Hector Gannet are from the town of North Shields, high on England’s north east coast. Things centre on lead singer-songwriter Aaron Duff whose compositions draw closely on his beloved home terrain. Yet Hector Gannet’s music – folk, rock, ancient, modern – also reaches out into the wider world. Hector Gannet have been praised by music lovers from Chris Packham to Sam Fender, while Uncut magazine acclaimed the band as “North Shields’ answer to Crazy Horse”. There have been live dates with artists from Elbow, Sea Power to Lindisfarne, Richard Thompson &amp; Kathryn Williams – &amp; massive shows with Sam Fender at the vast North Eastern shrine that is St James’ Park football ground. Hector Gannet have drawn pleasing reactions. On BBC 6 Music, musician and broadcaster Tom Robinson greeted a “band of exceptional talent”. In a **** review, MOJO magazine saluted the “pointedly political, natural-world-advocating folk rock” of their The Land Belongs To Us album. Louder Than War website put Hector Gannet among 25 bands to change your life. Forthcoming album includes rousing soul sermons which blend their North Eastern heart with touches of Dexy’s, Style Council-period Weller and a bit of the Boss</p>
