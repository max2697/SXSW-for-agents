  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>RAKEL is an Icelandic artist working in song, memory, and atmosphere. Her music folds together voice, field recording, and emotion into layered compositions that feel intimate and expansive. She has become a quietly singular presence in the Icelandic music landscape, performing with artists like Nanna (Of Monsters and Men), Axel Flóvent, and Kaktus Einarsson. Her debut album - a place to be - was released on Ólafur Arnalds’ OPIA Community in October 2025 and garnered widespread acclaim from top Icelandic and global media alikel, with The Line of Best Fit calling her “Iceland’s next breakout star” and writeups in Billboard, Exclaim!, SPIN, London Standard and more. She dominated the Iceland Airwaves festival in November 2025, with the festival awarding her the prestigious “PLUS Award”, granted to one artist each year that is ready to take over the world. 

a place to be is part diary, part landscape. Birds, clocks, breath, soft synths, the creak of a floorboard, nothing is too small to become part of the composition. RAKEL’s work invites you into a space where thought becomes sound, memory becomes movement, and music becomes a place to be, for now.</p>
