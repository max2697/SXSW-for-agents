  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Babatunde Akinboboye is an internationally celebrated Nigerian-American baritone and the pioneering force behind Hip Hopera—a bold, genre-defying fusion of classical opera and hip-hop. With a powerful operatic voice and magnetic stage presence, Babatunde merges centuries-old vocal mastery with the cultural pulse of modern Black music, creating a sound that is as revolutionary as it is resonant.
Born of Nigerian descent and classically trained in Western opera, Babatunde’s unique cultural and musical background fuels his mission to make opera more accessible and culturally relevant. His breakout moment came in 2018 when he went viral for blending Rossini’s Largo al Factotum with Kendrick Lamar’s HUMBLE—a performance that amassed over 10 million views and earned global media coverage from TIME, MSN, and Classic FM.

Since then, Babatunde has refined Hip Hopera into a distinct artistic movement, captivating audiences across the world through both digital platforms and live performance. With a loyal global following in the millions, he has become a cultural influencer who is using his voice—literally and figuratively—to expand the boundaries of what opera can be.
His classical résumé is just as compelling. He has performed lead roles with renowned companies such as Los Angeles Opera, Detroit Opera, and Utah Opera, including standout performances in The Central Park Five, Carmen, and Faust. A passionate advocate for African and African American composers, Babatunde brings visibility and vitality to voices often excluded from the classical canon.

Following his successful City Winery tour, Babatunde is preparing to release his debut studio album and headline an international tour in  2026—a showcase of how Hip Hopera continues to evolve as both an art form and a cultural bridge.</p>
