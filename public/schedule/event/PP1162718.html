      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Jacqueline Coleman, the 58th Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky, has been an active partner in the Beshear-Coleman administration&#39;s effort to make the state a national model for infrastructure investment. The administration has secured billions in federal and state funding to modernize Kentucky for the 21st century, including ambitious projects to rebuild critical bridges, deliver clean water and overhaul essential public works.\r\rHer approach to infrastructure is people-centric and deeply shaped by her career as an educator and growing up in rural Kentucky. She believes that true progress is measured by how infrastructure and economic development projects translate into tangible benefits for families. Having played a key role in the state&#39;s response to catastrophic 2021 tornadoes and 2022 floods, she brings a powerful perspective on the urgent need for resilient infrastructure and the leadership required to continually develop a workforce and rebuild communities in crisis.&quot;,
