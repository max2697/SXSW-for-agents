  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Do you wish you could predict the future? Come challenge our panel of futurists as they try to do it themselves! 

In 2024, SXSW attendees put a panel of futurists’ knowledge to the test, challenging them to improvise their view on the future of 18 audience-selected topics from toilet paper to war to thinking. Attendees submitted ideas into a fishbowl that spurred a constructive view of the future of a topic, in 3 minutes or less. This year we hope to return bigger and better with some new tricks and twists. Expect a rousing, dynamic, fun-filled adventure into the future and beyond!</p>
