  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>When disaster strikes, there’s no time for creative review. Just hours after violence, fires, hurricanes, war, or other crises strike, frontline groups like World Central Kitchen and Watch Duty hit the ground to save lives, and their marketing and comms teams begin rallying attention and mobilizing donations to make it all possible. In this session, WCK’s Linda Roth, Chief Communications and Strategy Officer, and Liz Caselli-Mechael, Chief Communications Officer at Watch Duty, join Swayable CEO James Slezak to reveal how some of the world’s most important campaigns are using AI and cutting-edge measurement technology to develop authentic, purpose-driven content that works—quickly.</p>
