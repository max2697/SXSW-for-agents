  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Anaya Kobe is a Houston-based Hip-Hop and R&amp;B artist originally from Columbus, Ohio, known for her emotionally resonant lyricism, refined storytelling, and moody, early-2000s-inspired aesthetic. A classically trained musician and lifelong creative, she blends soulful melodies with incisive rap, exploring themes of love, power, vulnerability, and personal reckoning.

Her most-streamed single, “Love Sick,” has connected deeply with listeners, showcasing her ability to translate emotional complexity into memorable hooks and intimate songwriting.

In 2025, Anaya released her second EP, Lord Save Me, a fully self-directed, zero-budget visual project that reflects her commitment to cohesive storytelling and independent creative control. She was selected as an official SXSW Artist for 2025 and has been featured in The Austin Chronicle for her live performances, recognized for their commanding presence and genre-blending sound.

With a growing catalog and a distinct visual identity, Anaya Kobe continues to carve out her own lane — poised, emotionally compelling, and unmistakably her own</p>
