  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Three sisters from rural New Hampshire formed a band in the late 1960s, but not by choice. Betty, Dorothy, and Helen Wiggin had no interest in playing music. In fact, they had no musical abilities at all. It was their father Austin, inspired by a prophecy, who became convinced that his girls would become rock stars. He pulled his daughters out of school, bought them a pair of cheap guitars and a drum kit, dubbed them The Shaggs, and basically commanded them to make music. In 1969, he brought the girls to a storefront recording studio outside of Boston, and the result is one of the most head-scratching and polarizing albums ever committed to vinyl. &quot;We Are The Shaggs&quot; is their story.</p>
