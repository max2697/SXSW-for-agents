  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>For over two decades, Marissa Nadler has carved out a singular place in the musical landscape, where ethereal folk, shadowy Americana, ambient soundscapes, and experimental textures converge. Anchored by her unmistakable mezzo-soprano and fingerstyle guitar, Nadler’s music conjures vivid emotional worlds—intimate, otherworldly, and timeless.
A prolific songwriter, Nadler has built a discography defined by spectral beauty and haunting lyricism. Her songs, dreamlike and lush, are rich with imagery and nuance. Nadler released her debut album, Ballads of Living and Dying,  in 2004, a collection that announced her as a major voice in the underground. A skilled visual artist as well, Nadler’s background in painting deeply informs the cinematic scope of her songs. Following her early work, she partnered with Sacred Bones and Bella Union for July (2014), marking a new chapter in creative clarity and critical acclaim. Strangers (2016), For My Crimes (2018), and The Path of the Clouds (2021) further expanded her sonic palette.
Her 10th full-length, New Radiations, was released on August 15th. Expansive, melodic, and emotionally vivid, it captures Nadler at her most personal and visionary.</p>
