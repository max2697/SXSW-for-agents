  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Neuroaesthetics is the science of how art, design, culture, and technology shape the brain and body, impacting emotion, connection, and behavior. Bringing together leaders in neuroscience, art, and technology this panel unpacks the rising field of neuroaesthetics as a new essential for the future of design. Through research, experiential and digital design work from leaders in the field, we’ll explore how this interdisciplinary field is redefining how we create, collaborate, and care, offering new tools to design for health, meaning, and human experience in an increasingly complex world.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Lachlan Turczan (b. 1993, Pasadena) is a Los Angeles–based artist working with water, light, and sound to explore the limits of perception. A graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, he spent years choreographing large-scale fountains for WET Design in Dubai, Singapore, and Las Vegas before establishing his independent studio. His practice centres on cymatics—using vibration to shape water into dynamic sculptures of reflected light. Works such as Wavespace, Sympathetic Resonance, and Lucida have been shown at Milan Design Week, Noor Riyadh, and Art Basel Hong Kong. Lucida immerses audiences in architectural environments of liquid light, responsive to sound and movement. Turczan’s work extends the Light and Space tradition, introducing sound, interaction, and fluid dynamics.&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Susan Magsamen is founder and executive director of the International Arts + Mind Lab, Center for Applied Neuroaesthetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She explores how arts and aesthetic experiences measurably change the brain, body, and behaviour, and translates this into applications for health, wellbeing, and learning. An entrepreneur, she founded Curiosity Kits and Curiosityville, award-winning education companies recognised with over 600 innovation awards. Author of seven books, she also developed Impact Thinking, a translational research model applying scientific methods to arts and aesthetics with a focus on real-world impact. Susan co-directs the NeuroArts Blueprint with the Aspen Institute, advancing integration of the arts into medicine and public health.&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Robyn Landau is a neuroaesthetics researcher, designer, and cultural entrepreneur advancing new interdisciplinary models connecting neuroscience with creative experiences. As the co-founder of Kinda, the first women-led neuroaesthetics studio and lab, she pioneers new ways to measure, design, and translate scientific insights into cultural experiences, expanding its human connection and wellbeing. Robyn is reshaping how we engage with science in the real world through  projects fusing  neurotechnology with sensory-driven storytelling that transform how audiences experience art, space, and emotion. Through research-driven designs, interactive installations and mental health interventions, she creates embodied experiences that deepen the ways we connect. &quot;,
