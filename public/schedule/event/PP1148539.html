  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>We’re wired to search. With billions of search queries per day, marketers have long known where and how to find their audiences.Now with the rise of generative engines and AI, the search landscape is facing its biggest upheaval in decades. Traditional search, long the backbone of digital strategy, is being rapidly replaced by generative engine optimization (GEO), fragmented user journeys, and new discovery ecosystems. This session will highlight immediate threats to legacy approaches and inspire strategies for brands, marketers, and advertisers to reclaim visibility and influence.</p>
