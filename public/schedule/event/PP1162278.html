  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Forget decks and buzzwords—this is a build-first session. In this interactive workshop, founders will use Vibe Coding, a fast, intuition-driven method for turning ideas into real products. Using LEGO® to spark rapid collaboration and system-level thinking, participants will physically map app components before we Vibe Code them into working software. Along the way, we’ll explore what it actually takes to build an enterprise-ready app—covering usability, security, reliability, and scalability—so speed doesn’t come at the expense of quality. Expect hands-on collaboration, high energy, and an open-source prototype you can keep building after SXSW. No coding expertise required—just ideas, creativity, and collaboration.</p>
