  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Rehash is an indie-rock band from South Florida that began with two high schoolers making music in their bedrooms. In June 2023, they wrote and recorded their self-titled debut album “Rehash”, cementing themselves as one of the most exciting emerging acts on the East Coast. To date, everything has been written, recorded, produced, mixed, and mastered by the band. Their latest project “mock” has been a favorite of fans since its release in June of 2025. With more music on the way, Rehash is gearing up for their biggest year yet. 

They started off touring on opening runs with acts like Alexsucks and Dogpark. They’re currently on tour and have sold out 75% of the shows. 

With the release of their sophomore album Mock in June 2025, Rehash saw explosive growth—streaming numbers jumped over 50% in the last two months, reaching over 5 million monthly streams. </p>
