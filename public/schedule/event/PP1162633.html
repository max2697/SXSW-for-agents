  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>While billions flow into tech, too little reaches the people building for equity, justice, and long-term public benefit. This session brings together leaders rethinking who gets to fund emerging tech and why—across both venture capital and philanthropy. We&#39;ll explore how to back founders closest to the problems, build alternatives to extractive tech, and redirect capital toward innovation that actually serves communities. It&#39;s time to expand who defines innovation—and who profits from it.</p>
