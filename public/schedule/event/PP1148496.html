  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Most career advice stinks.

Why? Because we can’t manage what we don’t measure, and most of us are flying blind.

Join futurist and three-time SXSW fan favorite Mike Bechtel as he turns his foresight toolkit inward and demystifies the future of career planning in the age of AI with a flight-tested dashboard he’s used himself for the past 20 years.

Over the course of this session, Mike will offer the audience tips, techniques, and even take-home-tech to help them determine their &quot;reason-for-being“, plot a practical path to get there, and critically, know when to make course corrections.

Tuned towards early to mid-stage professionals, with relevance to students and senior leaders seeking a recalibration, this fast, story-rich session blends personality with practicality, giving today’s audience the mindset and toolset to design more intentional futures.</p>
