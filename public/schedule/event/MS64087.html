  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>JAKE GATEWOOD is a Texas-based DJ, producer, creative director, and curator whose disco- and house-driven sound has become a staple on dance floors across the U.S. Known for groove-forward, high-energy sets, his work is built for packed rooms and long nights.

As an artist and curator, Jake has performed alongside and collaborated with acts including Yung Bae, Never Dull, Coco &amp; Breezy, Lee Foss, Marshall Jefferson, Joshwa &amp; more, earning a reputation for versatility behind the decks and a sharp ear for forward-thinking dance music.

In 2022, he founded Take A Break, a house-music label, event series, and festival platform that has quickly become a cornerstone of the Southern dance-music scene. After selling out 20 consecutive shows and moving over 20K tickets, Take A Break has grown into a multi-scale brand supporting both emerging and established artists.

Jake also maintains an ongoing partnership with Apple Music, curating DJ mixes and editorial content that bring his taste and perspective to a global audience. Beyond music, he is the creative force behind BOOGIES, a Dallas-based discotheque rooted in classic dance-floor culture with a modern edge.</p>
