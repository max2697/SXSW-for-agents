      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Born and raised in Guatemala, Austin is home now. Ever wondered why some stories stick while others fade? As a former marketer turned cookie entrepreneur and nonprofit founder, I&#39;ve found the answer: authenticity. At The Sunday Afternoon Project, we’re redefining storytelling. Our Fearless Storytelling™ workshops blend data with drama, creating authentic connections in a world of artificial engagement. My passion? Making complex ideas simple and engaging. Whether it’s the story behind a cookie or a life journey, I transform the intimidating into something accessible and impactful. Curious how your story could be a game-changer? Let’s chat—because in life’s big story, we’re all co-authors.&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;I grew up knowing I had a gift: I could make anyone feel comfortable. I could read a room, ask the right question, see the joy in someone even when they&#39;re hiding it. For a long time, I didn&#39;t know what to do with that.\n\nThen I picked up a camera.\n\nNow I run Sunday Afternoon Project and Storytellers Photo Lab. With my photography I don&#39;t chase technical perfection. I chase real moments. Connection. Vulnerability mixed with confidence. I create spaces where people&#39;s walls come down, and that&#39;s when the actual magic happens. That&#39;s when you see yourself the way I see you, powerful, joyful, genuinely yourself.\n\nMy mission is simple: help people realize they&#39;re way more interesting, way more beautiful, way more capable than they give themselves credit for. And then prove it in photos and everything I do.\n\nBecause here&#39;s what I believe: you deserve to see yourself joyfully. And I&#39;m here to help you get there.&quot;,
