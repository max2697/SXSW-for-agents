      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;As Founder &amp; CEO of Tony Fay Public Relations (TFPR), Fay leads the nationally-recognized communications agency. The firm has been a finalist for Small Agency of the Year three times (2024, 2023, 2022) at the PRNEWS Platinum Awards, winning the award in 2023, and has been recognized as part of the PRNEWS Agency Elite Top 120 list each of the last three years (2026, 2025 and 2024). TFPR was also awarded a 2025 PRSA Award of Excellence among its PR firm peers at the 81st anniversary Anvil Awards in New York City. Fay was named as one of PRNEWS’ 2024 People of the Year in the CEO category; PRNEWS scours the nation for the most inspiring public relations professionals. The list starts with CEOs and also includes top marketing innovators, crisis communicators, and media relations specialists. Fay also won a prestigious PRSA Dallas Pegasus Award for 2024 PR Executive of the Year.\r\rTony Fay PR has been named to Sports Business Journal’s list for Best Places to Work in Sports in 2025, 2024 and 2023.\r\rCombining a leading sports practice with an impressive roster of non-profit clients, TFPR’s storytelling impact can be felt both through acclaimed worldwide events and heartwarming philanthropic efforts that bring communities together. Among its sports clients, TFPR proudly represents the College Football Playoff, PGA of America, Dallas Stars, GF Sports &amp; Entertainment, Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic, Florida Citrus Sports, Dallas Wings, Dallas Trinity FC, and American Airlines Center. Also in its entertainment portfolio, the firm delivers for Choctaw Casinos &amp; Resorts, The American Rodeo, and Heritage Auctions. \r\rTFPR is one of a select handful of planning partners to work on each of the first 10 National Championships of the College Football Playoff era. The team has also led marketing communications, community impact and volunteer coordination for the North Texas Local Organizing Committee for 2014 NCAA Men’s Final Four and regional media outreach for WrestleMania XXXVIII, the 2023 NCAA Women’s Basketball Final Four, and twice the Academy of Country Music (ACM) Awards. \r\rThe firm’s non-profit roster includes stalwarts of Dallas philanthropy: Klyde Warren Park, United Way of Metropolitan Dallas, Perot Museum of Nature and Science, Children’s Medical Center Foundation, American Cancer Society, Children’s Cancer Fund, and St. Philip’s School and Community Center.  \r\rIn 2022, TFPR partnered with Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback and ESPN Monday Night Football analyst Troy Aikman to produce Highway to Henryetta Presented by AT&amp;T. The all-star country music festival, headlined by Blake Shelton, raised funds for Aikman’s hometown of Henryetta, Oklahoma. TFPR managed all aspects of the event, including soliciting high-level sponsors, booking a dozen performances, and selling enough tickets to effectively triple the town’s population during the festival. \r\rPrior to founding TFPR, Fay served as Vice President of Communications for the North Texas Super Bowl XLV Host Committee. Under his guidance, the North Texas Host Committee designed the largest community impact program in Super Bowl history, resulting in 44,140 North Texas youths (grades K-8) contributing 445,814 service hours. From 1987-1999, Fay worked for the Dallas Mavericks, rising from an intern to the head of the club’s communications department and a member of the senior management team.\r\rFay has been recognized six times (2020-2025) by D CEO magazine as part of its D500, recognizing the most influential business leaders in Dallas-Fort Worth. He serves on the Board of Directors of the Dallas chapter of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA). A proud product of the University of North Texas’ Mayborn School of Journalism, he served on the Mayborn School Board of Advisors (2012-14) and in 2013 received the Mayborn Alumni Appreciation award. Fay has run seven marathons, including the New York City Marathon twice (2017, 1997). Tony and his wife Kate have an affinity for animals, music, and running. His beloved daughter Katie is a recent graduate of SMU and is pursuing a career in public relations.&quot;,
