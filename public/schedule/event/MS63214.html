  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Born and raised in Austin, Texas, Calder Allen is a fifth-generation Texan whose music reflects the deep roots and creative spirit of his upbringing. Influenced by his artist grandparents, Terry and Jo Harvey Allen, Calder grew up surrounded by authentic artistic expression. Originally set on becoming a fly-fishing guide, he turned to songwriting during the 2020 pandemic, leading to his debut album The Game, produced by mentor Charlie Sexton.
With his new album, Fault Lines, recorded at Austin’s legendary Arlyn Studios with Sexton and Jacob Sciba, Calder delivers his most personal work yet—a cinematic exploration of love, loss, and self-discovery. Featuring contributions from Martie Maguire, Jon Randall, and Jack Ingram, the record captures the emotional depth and honesty at the heart of his songwriting.
A commanding live performer, Calder has shared stages with Cody Jinks, Turnpike Troubadours, Miranda Lambert, and others, earning acclaim at festivals like Austin City Limits, Bonnaroo, and Two Step Inn. With Fault Lines, Calder Allen cements himself as a powerful new voice in Americana, blending Texas tradition with raw, introspective storytelling.</p>
