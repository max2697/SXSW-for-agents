  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>In 2021, the United States was designated as a global backslider in the International IDEA report, a designation that remains. Part of that finding was attributed to a lack of effective parliament (Congress), the insurrection on January 6, 2021, and election denialism. In the years since, the concerns have only increased. This session will focus on how we, the people, respond. It will include a discussion of how we can work together to galvanize communities and local, state and federal leaders to reverse this trend, and what’s at stake.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Skye L. Perryman is the President and CEO of Democracy Forward, a nonpartisan, national legal organization that promotes democracy and progress through litigation, regulatory engagement, communications, policy education, and research. Named as one of the 2025 100 Most Influential People In The World by TIME Magazine, Ms. Perryman took the helm at Democracy Forward a few months after January 6, 2021, in the midst of rising extremism in communities and courts across the country. She has built a visionary team of legal, policy, and communications experts to confront anti-democratic extremism head-on while also using the law to advance progress and a bold vision for the future. Under Ms. Perryman’s leadership, Democracy Forward has expanded the scope and reach of its work, emerging as a nationally recognized institution that is taking on the most significant issues affecting people, families, and communities– from defending civil rights and fair wages to seeking to expand access to reproductive health care post-Dobbs to confronting attacks on education to addressing the climate crisis and much more. &quot;,
