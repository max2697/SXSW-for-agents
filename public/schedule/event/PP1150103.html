  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>AI-native has become the goal, but for many organizations it’s unrealistic or unnecessary. This conversation will look honestly at what AI-native really means and why teams get stuck trying to achieve it. We’ll explore the technical, organizational, and human bottlenecks that hold companies back, and how strong leaders decide when to invest, when to adapt, and when to walk away. A grounded discussion about tradeoffs, judgment, and practical AI outcomes.</p>
