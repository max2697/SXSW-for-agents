  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>What if high school, college, and career weren’t separate systems—but one seamless experience designed to help today’s learners succeed in a fast-changing world of work? This panel explores “The Big Blur,” a bold vision to redesign how we educate 16–20-year-olds by erasing the boundaries between K–12, higher education, and work. Panelists will share how they’re building learning models that integrate academics, career-connected learning, and real credentials—starting in high school. Hear how these efforts are creating real opportunity for students and what it will take to scale nationwide.</p>
