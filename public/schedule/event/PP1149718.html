  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Generative AI is rapidly reshaping how young people learn, connect, and understand themselves. From AI tutors and creative tools to always-on digital companions, these technologies promise new opportunities, but also raise urgent questions about children’s cognitive, social, and emotional development. Rather than focusing on whether AI should be used in education, how do we ensure AI strengthens—rather than undermines—young people’s capacity to think, relate, and thrive?

Drawing from the recent Brookings report &quot;A New Direction for Students in an AI World: Prosper, Prepare, Protect,” with data across 50 countries, this panel will include a rich mix of perspectives and explore what it truly means to support resilient youth in an AI-saturated world.</p>

She currently serves as the Director of Learning Initiatives at Google DeepMind, where she leads efforts to explore how the future of AI can help advance and augment teaching, learning and human development. She’s deeply committed to cultivating collaboration across the broader education ecosystem to ensure that AI is grounded in learning science, built responsibly, researched rigorously, distributed equitably and fosters durable outcomes. \r\rMiriam’s fingerprints are etched throughout Google’s history in learning and education. During her tenure, she has built and led high-performing marketing and strategy teams across the company’s broad portfolio of education products, including Google Classroom and Chromebooks. She has been a foundational architect of Google’s holistic approach to education, dating back to the company’s early days roadtripping to college campuses in an iconic 1970s biodiesel school bus. More recently, she introduced LearnLM — the world’s most pedagogical AI — and has helped establish global advisory boards, student-focused programs, and communities of practice to enhance engagement with leading industry experts, practitioners and learners. \r\rMiriam is known for her unwavering passion for her work, innate desire to elevate and celebrate educators, and steadfast belief that everyone deserves access to high quality learning experiences. She believes the world runs on relationships and that curiosity is our currency of connection. \r\rShe is an avid crafter (letterpress and calligraphy), active mother (to Poppy and Owen), podcast enthusiast (welcomes all recommendations!) who tries to forest bathe as much as possible. She graduated Summa Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa from UCLA and studied French at the Sorbonne. &quot;,
