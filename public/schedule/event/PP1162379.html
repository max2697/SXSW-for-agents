  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Headlines warn that AI is hurting DEIB—propagating bias, reinforcing stereotypes, and risking the erasure of marginalized groups and their histories. Yet the same technology has the potential to uncover bias, scale representation, and raise the bar for inclusion at the brand, industry, academic, and societal levels.

With a consumer-focused lens, panelists from MAC Cosmetics, the UN, NYU, and Responsible AI company, SeeMe Index, will explore both sides of the equation: where AI’s blind spots have failed us, where it’s driving progress, and what it takes to ensure technology reflects the world we want to see.</p>
