  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Atlanta-based artist Spencer Thomas returns with Cynical Vision, his third and most incisive album yet, out March 20, 2026. Wry and sardonic, the record balances humor and existential dread, blending retro synths, vintage drum machines, and fuzzed-out guitars into an intoxicating mix of analog and electronic sounds. Nods to Randy Newman, Lou Reed, Warren Zevon, and Tom Petty shine through as Thomas holds a mirror to modern life, delivering a whip-smart meditation on the absurdity and beauty of living and loving in the 21st century.

“In a lot of ways, it felt impossible for me to not write about this stuff,” Thomas says. “I leaned into what felt interesting and current and funny, and tried to make something visceral and honest.”

After releasing his 2019 solo debut Hangin’ Tough, he moved to Athens, GA in 2020 and joined indie rock band Futurebirds as their keyboardist. “It was a fantastic opportunity,” he explains, “but it kept me away from home and from my own music.” His 2024 sophomore album The Joke of Life earned rave reviews, and in 2025 he stepped away from Futurebirds to devote himself fully to creating Cynical Vision.</p>
