  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>An ancient African medicine, Iboga, contains the most powerful psychedelic on the planet - ibogaine.  Known for decades in the underground of the West as a profound interrupter of drug addiction, U.S. military veterans have been fleeing to Mexico to access ibogaine treatment in a desperate struggle to save themselves from the physical, psychological, and spiritual ravages of war.  Recent medical discoveries related to ibogaine’s impact on the brain suggest that it may also be the most sophisticated molecule on the planet, holding revolutionary potential to transform the lives of millions across the world whose debilities are not responsive to synthetic pharmacology.  The pursuit of ibogaine’s medicalization within the United States is a daunting mission uniting diverse communities with common afflictions against institutional obstacles which expose and illuminate the dysfunctions of power over people as well as the monumental opportunity we now have for people to prevail over power.</p>

Additionally, Dr. Dölen maintains an adjunct professorship in Neuroscience and Neurology at Johns Hopkins University and is the Director of the PHATHOM project (Psychedelic Healing: Adjunct Therapy Harnessing Opened Malleability). Dr. Dölen earned her M.D., Ph.D. at Brown University and MIT and completed postdoctoral training at Stanford University. Dr. Dölen is a pioneer and world leader of psychedelics research. Based on a series of breakthrough discoveries she has formulated the hypothesis psychedelics may be the long sought “master key” for unlocking critical periods across the brain. Importantly, understanding psychedelics through this framework dramatically expands the scope of disorders that might benefit from adjunct therapy with psychedelics. Dr. Dölen is the recipient of the Joukowsky Family Foundation Award, the Conquer Fragile X Rising Star Award, the Angus MacDonald Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching, the Society for Social Neuroscience Early Career Award, the Searle Scholars Award, and the Johns Hopkins University President’s Frontier Award.  &quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Rick Perry served as the fourteenth United States Secretary of Energy from March 2017 to December 2019.  As Secretary, he was responsible for successfully executing President Donald J. Trump’s energy agenda and the expansive mission of the Department of Energy (DOE), including maintaining the safety and security of the nation’s nuclear arsenal, protecting the electric grid from cyber threats, ensuring access to reliable and affordable energy, overseeing scientific research and development, and promoting the development and export of American technology and energy all over the world. Under his leadership, the nation ushered in a historic energy era, becoming the number one producer of oil and gas in the world, a world leader in the production and generation of renewable energy, and the dominant global force in Supercomputing, Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence. \r\rPrior to joining the Trump Administration, Perry served as the 47th Governor of Texas from 2000-2015. As the longest serving governor of the Lone Star State, he championed conservative pro-growth principles that made Texas the world’s 12th largest economy and the economic envy of America. During his time in Austin, Governor Perry also implemented transformative reforms in the areas of security, criminal justice reform, energy, education, healthcare and the economy. \r\rAs Chief Executive both as Governor of Texas and Secretary of Energy, Perry understood that the success of government is only as strong as its partnerships with the private sector. He advocated for smart regulatory reforms and strong public-private partnerships, empowering industry rather that creating more bureaucratic barriers. He started the Texas Enterprise Fund which lured hundreds of millions of dollars in private sector business and jobs to Texas. At DOE, he appointed the first ever Chief Commercialization Officer who was tasked with bridging the gap between the world-class R&amp;D at the Department’s 17 National Laboratories and commercialization in the private sector. \r\rRick Perry is a veteran of the United States Air Force, where he flew a C-130 tactical airlift aircraft in Europe and the Middle East. Throughout his career, he has been deeply involved in supporting both the active duty and veteran community, most recently as an advocate for using the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deliver precision health care to warriors suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and other conditions.\r\rPerry earned distinction early in his life as an Eagle Scout. He was one of the first in his family to go to college, earning a degree in Animal Science from Texas A&amp;M University, where he was a member of the Corps of Cadets and a Yell Leader. He is a lifetime member of both the NRA and American Legion Post #75.\r\rPerry married his childhood sweetheart, Anita, in 1982. They have two children, two beautiful granddaughters, and two handsome grandsons. &quot;,
