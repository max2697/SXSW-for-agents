  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>“We have never seen a proposal even remotely similar to that of Ain TheMachine.” — DJ Mag

Ain TheMachine is a Grammy-nominated Brazilian artist based in Berlin whose work reimagines how electronic music is made and performed. Instead of conventional instruments, he creates music live from the body, the voice and everyday objects, working across genres from Brazilian downtempo to Techno. His shows and videos often break the fourth wall, inviting the audience to contribute sounds that become part of the piece.

His unique approach has drawn international attention: he has been featured in one of Beatport’s most viewed and commented posts and has performed at iconic clubs and festivals such as Fusion Festival (Germany), Sisyphos (Berlin), D-EDGE (Brazil) and Suma Han (Turkey). Supported by artists including Purple Disco Machine, Sam Divine and Mano Le Tough, he releases music on his label Mundo Afora Records and on respected imprints such as Black Book.

He has delivered four TEDx talks in three countries, played with Prince’s guitarist Miko Weaver, jammed with Bobby McFerrin, and had his productions remixed by Mad Professor.</p>
