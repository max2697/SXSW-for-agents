  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Glassio is the Dream-Pop–tinged Indie-Dance project of Irish-Iranian songwriter and producer Sam R. Blending melodic sweetness with brooding dance beats, his self-described “melancholy disco” sound has earned over 25 million streams and global acclaim. Since emerging with the viral 2016 EP Poptimism (whose single “Try Much Harder” hit No. 9 on Spotify’s Global Viral Chart), Glassio has toured internationally with acts like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Nada Surf, and Electric Youth, and released two acclaimed LPs—For the Very Last Time (2020, Downtown Music) and See You Shine (2022)—with songs featured on Netflix and HBO. Raised between the Middle East and California and later based in New York and London, Sam draws influence from New Wave, 60s chamber pop, and early-2000s electronica, channeling it into rich, cinematic pop. His upcoming third album, The Imposter (2026), written during his move from New York to London, fuses shoegaze, folk, and dream pop in a neo-noir exploration of self-confrontation and creative rebirth. “I wanted this album to make people ask if they’re living the life they’re meant to,” he says. “For me, this is about rediscovering who I am as an artist.</p>
