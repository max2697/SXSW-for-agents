  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>A fireside chat with Jason Kim, CEO, and Brigette Oakes, VP of Engineering, at Firefly Aerospace. In 2025, Firefly became the first commercial company to successfully land on the Moon, and now the company is working towards a repeat in 2026. Firefly’s next lunar is bigger and bolder, set to land on the far side of the Moon for the first time in American history. This company is simultaneously launching rockets to fill a void in the growing satellite market while also preparing to orbit a constellation of spacecraft in support of in-space maneuverability, space domain awareness, and more. Jason and Brigette will discuss what’s next for the company and where the space industry is headed next.</p>
