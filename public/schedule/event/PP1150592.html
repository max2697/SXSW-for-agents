  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Malls may be losing commercial relevance, but some brands are reclaiming their cultural relevance. In a widely successful experimental pilot, Hot Topic has launched two social-first sitcoms shot entirely in malls, casting creators from punk, goth, and cosplay scenes to reclaim its ALT roots. As Gen Z flocks back to IRL hangouts and “third places,” the brand is transforming shopping centres into entertainment stages. It’s part of a wider shift toward entertainment-first marketing, echoing moves by brands like Dick’s Sporting Goods, which have built in-house studios to power the growth of their own and partner brands. Hear from Hot Topic and their agency partners Small W•rld about how to pull this strategy off successfully.</p>
