  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Vivir Quintana is a Mexican singer, composer, and women’s rights activist renowned for blending regional Mexican with different genders. She is widely considered one of Latin America&#39;s most powerful voices. Her landmark track, &quot;Canción sin miedo,&quot; has become a global feminist anthem against gender-based violence, translated and adapted worldwide.

Vivir was a student at the SACM composition workshop, in which she earned the María Grevers and FONCA scholarships and won the &quot;Éxito SACM 2021&quot; award for Best Independent Song. Forbes also recognized her as one of Mexico&#39;s 100 most creative people.

She has shared the stage with icons like Mon Laferte, Andrea Echeverri, Majo Aguilar and Rubén Albarrán.

Currently, she is promoting her second album under Universal Music Mexico, &quot;Cosas que sorprenden a la audiencia&quot; this is a powerful reinterpretation of the traditional Mexican corrido, transforming the genre into an instrument of social justice. The album features ten songs narrated in the first person, telling the true stories of women who were incarcerated or deprived of their physical liberty for defending themselves against gender-based violence and their abusers. </p>
