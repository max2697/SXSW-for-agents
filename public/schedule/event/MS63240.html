  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Grocery Bag are the latest in a new breed of face-melting rock &amp; roll straight out of Austin, Texas. The garage rock-psych-punk 4 piece, led by diminutive singer Bella Martinez, have been tearing up stages around Texas since 2023, being handpicked by the likes of Osees, Frankie &amp; The Witch Fingers &amp; Farmer&#39;s Wife to support on multiple shows as well as a critically-acclaimed set at Levitation Festival 2024. Following this breakthrough performance, the band were added as main support on Psychedelic Porn Crumpets tour in April/May 2025, playing 22 shows &amp; solidifying their reputation as one of the best live bands in the country. Their debut album &#39;Break You&#39; (released in Nov 2023) is a great raw snapshot of young talented musicians creating something exciting, to-the-point, that leaves you replaying time &amp; time again. New music is expected early 2026!</p>
