  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>VUKOVI are a dynamic two-piece alt-rock outfit from Scotland fronted by vocalist Janine Shilstone and guitarist Hamish Reilly. Their sound combines blistering riffs and melodic vocals with elements of heavy-rock, noise-pop, and nu-metal, suitable for fans of Bring Me The Horizon, PVRIS, Don Broco and Rage Against The Machine. Following the critical success of their 2017 debut (‘VUKOVI’) and the electrifying follow-up ‘Fall Better’ (2020), VUKOVI truly ascended to stratospheric new heights with their third album, ‘NULA’ (2022). While ‘La Di Da’, drawn from their debut, remains a perennial fan favourite, tracks such as ‘LASSO’, ‘HADES’ and the anthemic ‘I EXIST’ continue to command chaos from fans in live settings across the globe. VUKOVI released their latest album ‘MY GOD HAS GOT A GUN’ via Sharptone Records in 2025, recorded and co-produced by legendary Machine at The Machine Shop Studio in Texas. The album garnered praise for its cathartic yet exorcistic expression of themes surrounding mental health, religion and female empowerment. 
Having toured with the likes of Babymetal, Enter Shikari, PVRIS, Nothing More and One Ok Rock, VUKOVI continue to build their audiences worldwide.</p>
