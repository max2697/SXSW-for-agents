  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>From button-mashing to brain-driven play, neurogaming is set to rewrite the rulebook. This panel hosted by OpenBCI gathers neurogamers and more to show how real-time EEG/EMG decoding replaces sticks and keys with pure intent, unlocking worlds that respond to mood, focus, and micro-gestures. We’ll spotlight a live neurogaming case study, unpack further real-world examples, and sketch the roadmap toward a brain-driven future of play.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Perri Karyal holds an MSc in Psychology and channels her academic EEG expertise into real-time brain-computer interfaces for play. On Twitch and YouTube she maps distinct brain-wave signatures, inner-ear muscle cues and voice commands to virtual game-pad inputs, famously completing Elden Ring and other titles without touching a controller. Her how-to streams and interviews (BBC News clips to IEEE and Psychology Today Articles) demystify neuro-gaming pipelines for hobbyists and studios. Current projects include partnering with EarSwitch to evaluate ear-rumble click tech and advising academic labs on low-latency BCI design that broadens accessibility. Blending psychology, software and live entertainment, she shows how biosensing becomes accessible to players of every ability.&quot;,
