  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Honey I&#39;m Home is an Amsterdam-based shoegaze outfit that powerfully captures the raw energy of &#39;90s alternative rock and blends it with a fresh, modern sound. Inspired by bands like My Bloody Valentine, Smashing Pumpkins, and DIIV, they&#39;ve created their own unique take on the shoegaze, indie, and emo genres. On stage, Honey I&#39;m Home unleashes their full power: captivating live shows that balance between fragile intimacy and explosive outbursts carried by layered guitars and deeply felt lyrics.

Recently named #1 emerging act at Europe’s leading new-music showcase festival (ESNS), a list with a strong track record of identifying artists before their breakthrough. “Honey I&#39;m Home is reaping the benefits of the shoegaze revival. But it&#39;s not just timing, they are really great. The packed room gets their faces melted off, but sometimes gets a breather in the shape of a beautiful verse. The unexpected breaks, original melodies and smart tempo changes give the set its own, authentic sound.”

The band supported Hotline TNT, Goat Girl and the Crawlers on shows throughout the EU and UK, and played key European showcase festivals including ESNS, Reeperbahn Festival and Left of the Dial.</p>
