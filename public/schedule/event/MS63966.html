  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Olivia Ellen Lloyd will try anything once. From flight attendant school in Dallas to producing theater in New York City and teaching in Guatemala, Lloyd sought an adventurous life, but struggled to find a greater sense of purpose. That is, until she found her way back to music. Lloyd channels her restless spirit into songs that pay homage to her Appalachian roots while charting fresh territory for a sound that is uniquely her own. 

Heavily influenced by country, folk, and indie rock, Lloyd’s sound combines the rooted sounds of her traditional Appalachian upbringing with the fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants nature of her current life. She is inspired by the rich sounds of New York City, the peaceful quiet of her small West Virginia hometown, and life on the road in between.

Her 2025 sophomore record &quot;Do It Myself&quot; landed her debut appearances at Mountain Stage, Americana Fest, and Brooklyn Folk Festival and her debut album, Loose Cannon, has been streamed over 1 million times while Olivia has been busy crossing the country opening for artists like Kelsey Waldon, Tommy Prine, and Jobi Riccio, winning songwriting contests (Kerrville in 2023), and generally eating life down to the rind.</p>
