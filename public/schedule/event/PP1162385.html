  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Congrats, you can release a song in 10 minutes. Now do that every week, promote it constantly, and hope the algorithm’s in a good mood. Everyone celebrates accessibility, but nobody talks about how creators are stuck in a never-ending cycle of release, promote, repeat, with fewer results. What happens when the platforms encourage constant output, but discovery is increasingly unpredictable and unsustainable? Is the current system helping artists succeed, or just keeping them busy? The volume is up, so how do we tune into what really resonates?</p>
