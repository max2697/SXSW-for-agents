  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Private markets are no longer the exclusive domain of institutional giants. With retail investors entering the fold, liquidity reshaping exits, and new secondary structures emerging, the rules of the game are changing fast. For founders, this shift represents both an opportunity and a challenge: how to raise and scale in an environment that looks very different from even five years ago. Nizar Tarhuni, EVP of Research and Market Intelligence at PitchBook will unpack the key forces transforming private markets—and what they mean for startups in 2026 and beyond.</p>
