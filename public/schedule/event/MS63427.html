  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Dallas Tenus is a four piece rock band from Raleigh, North Carolina that formed in 2022 and includes a collective of members who have traveled the world playing and performing music.  The four established band members - Greg Clayton (Rhythm guitar and vocals), Billy Alphin (drums), Danny Kurtz (lead guitar) and David Wright (bass guitar) - have collectively played in various major label and national touring bands through the years including Whiskeytown, AntiSeen, Drivin’ n Cryin&#39;, Flat Duo Jets, Squirrel Nut Zippers, The Backsliders, Sarah Shook, Lustre, and The Rosebuds (to name a few).  The new collective that is Dallas Tetnus is a musical combination of all of these influences, with a stage show that is packed with static energy and a pure rock showmanship that is one to be seen.

The band plays loud, short, catchy, 70s - inspired tunes with influences from The Ramones, The Stooges, and KISS. Their unique and original stage presence is hard to forget. Their shows have plenty of visual appeal and engagement with smoke and bubbles rolling through every set, with white suits and a pink lit backdrop to boot.  

The debut album, Welcome To Dallas Tetnus, is available everywhere now.</p>
