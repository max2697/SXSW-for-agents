  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The increasing number and brightness of satellite constellations in Earth&#39;s orbit are significantly impacting ground-based and optical astronomy. So how do we balance humanity&#39;s expansion into space while protecting our study of the stars from Earth? Join the conversation on a sustainable future for space and hear from the experts on the front lines—astronomers, satellite companies, and space industry pioneers—as they discuss collaborative solutions to mitigate satellite brightness and preserve our night sky.</p>
