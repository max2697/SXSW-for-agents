  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Modern CMOs have cracked the code: AI doesn&#39;t kill authenticity—it supercharges it. In this session, several CMOs skip the hype to share what actually works. They&#39;ve turned algorithms into empathy and data into deeper human connections. No fluff, no buzzwords—just the real wins, messy learnings, and breakthrough moments that separate leaders from followers. These aren&#39;t your typical &quot;AI will save us all&quot; stories. They&#39;re practical insights on building marketing that genuinely serves people, not just metrics.</p>
