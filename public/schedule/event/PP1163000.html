  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Using the scripted podcast Red Weather as a focused case study, this session explores how narrative audio is developed from script to final performance, and why podcasts have become a powerful, creator-driven pathway for original IP. With creator Rider Strong and key cast members, the panel examines writing, performance, and collaboration, with a focus on practical, on-location recording in real environments — redwoods, diners, and moving cars — and how physical space shapes immersive audio storytelling.</p>
