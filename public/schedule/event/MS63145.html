  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Karma Sheen is a London-based project led by British-Pakistani artist Sameer Khan, fusing the spirit of psychedelic rock with the emotional depth of Hindustani Classical music. Born from the tension between tradition and distortion, the project reimagines raag-based forms through fuzz pedals, improvisation and diasporic imagination.
Rooted in Khan’s training under Ustaad Latafat Ali Khan (Sham Chaurasi Gharana), Karma Sheen translates classical ornamentation into immersive soundscapes. Khan is joined by guitarist Amad Chima, sitarist Rodrigo Bourganos, bassist and visual artist Grisha Grebbenikov, and drummer/DJ Arun Dhanjal, forming a collaboration that bridges ancient lineage with contemporary subculture.
The band released their debut album in 2023, followed by extensive UK and European touring, including sold-out headline shows at Rich Mix and the 100 Club, and festival appearances at Shambala and Trans Musicales, where they recorded a KEXP live session due for release in early 2026.
Now working with EBB Music, Karma Sheen are building international momentum as they prepare to release their second album in 2026.</p>
