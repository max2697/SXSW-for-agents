  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>​Today’s leading creators aren’t just entertaining; they’re teaching and sharing information. From wellness challenges and cohort-based coaching to digital courses and paid memberships, creator-led learning has become one of the most sustainable ways to grow audience, revenue, and build community.

In this session, you’ll learn which learning formats from cohorts to in-person retreats are working now (and which have burned out). Panelists will break down how to design and monetize educational content that builds loyalty, whether you’re launching your first paid challenge, growing a coaching business, or integrating brand partners into your community. You’ll leave with a framework for launching your own “creator classroom”, one that deepens connection and drives consistent income.</p>
