  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Originally from the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina but currently living between LA, NYC and Richmond, VA; Lucaa (she/they) is the brainchild of singer/producer Stepha, who is a 2 spirit Afro-Indigenous artist whose genre-bending indie/alt-pop brand of music features raw and deceptively deep songwriting that pulls from their experiences as a young model in NYC, and being a queer BIPOC artist.  

At a young age, Lucaa remembers listening to their father (who was a backup singer for Stevie Wonder, Earth Wind and Fire, and Michael Jackson) and mother (a trained opera singer). After teaching themself how to sing and play songs on piano by ear, Lucaa now takes a grungier approach to altpop, with influences harnessed from Radiohead, Billie Eilish, Willow, &amp; girl in red.

Lucaa&#39;s career is growing quickly. A notable SXSW 2024 showcase early on led to major label interest and a fruitful year of performances and international branding campaigns with Leica Cameras and TurboTax. Lucaa was also a featured artist alongside Black Eyed Peas front man Taboo for Reserved Magazine, and appeared in Vogue Japan&#39;s October Edition (print), KEXP, Ones to Watch, and Them.</p>
