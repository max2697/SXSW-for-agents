  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Step inside the eye of the storm. &quot;Stormbound&quot; thrusts audiences into the heart of the world’s most powerful hurricanes with breathtaking, never-before-seen footage captured from within. As wind, water, and land collide, the film follows storm chaser Jeff Gammons, who for more than thirty years has pushed closer than anyone else to document every major hurricane to strike the United States. Now tested by a near fatal disease , Gammons continues his pursuit—revealing the personal cost of chasing nature at its most extreme and the larger environmental forces shaping our world. &quot;Stormbound&quot; is a high-stakes, immersive experience that places audiences face-to-face with nature at its most powerful.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Miko Lim is an award-winning director known for his authentic storytelling in extraordinary environments. \n\n\&quot;Stormbound,\&quot; Lim’s first IMAX feature film documentary, sees the director partnered with Producer Adam McKay. Filmed on IMAX cameras, the film follows a chronically ill man chasing the world’s largest hurricanes. In 2025, Lim was selected as the only shadow director for Apple TV’s \&quot;Murderbot\&quot; with showrunners Chris and Paul Weitz, which spent 10 weeks at #1 on Apple’s Most Streamed Chart. His short film \&quot;Ocean Mother\&quot; won him a Best Director Clio and his Adidas spot “What’s One More” was shortlisted at Cannes. His films have accumulated well over 1 billion views on YouTube, and he has the most-watched Adidas commercial of all time. Lim is a Paramount Global Director Fellow, and a co-chair of the DGA’s first feature film mentorship program alongside Lee Isaac Chung and Celine Song. In addition to his film work, Lim is an avid rock climber, free diver, and surfer, living in LA with his wife and three children.&quot;,
