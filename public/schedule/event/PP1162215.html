  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Cultural conversations around “main character energy” and a loneliness epidemic have made some feel like NPCs in the game of life. But what drives someone to join a Twitch stream or wear a jersey to a bar? Belonging. Fandoms aren’t mindless obsessions — they’re identity-shaping communities that turn disconnected observers into players. This talk explores how brands can drive growth through belonging by inviting people in through storytelling, access, and shared imagination—turning passive audiences into passionate communities.</p>
