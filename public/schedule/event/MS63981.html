  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Searching. Playfulness. Rediscovery of the once known. These thoughts permeate through Hanorah’s creative impulse. The multidisciplinary Canadian artist, chiefly known for her
powerful emotive voice, transforms the old into the new as she charts waters at once familiar and unknown. Weaving influences from RnB, rock, and shoegaze, she’s ready to redefine what soul music can be, exploring new sonic landscapes as she creates something both fresh and timeless.

Her new EP, Closer Than Hell, is a collection born from that very tension—between desire and uncertainty, between the things you don’t know and the parts of yourself you’re afraid to face. The theme of searching threads through each song, a quiet but persistent pull toward something elusive, something just out of reach. You hear it in the aching vulnerability of her lyrics, the way her voice rises and falls as if chasing after a feeling that might only exist for a fleeting second, before slipping away. But there’s play in it too. Her EP is about the delicate, messy dance between letting go and holding on—about being lost but also willing to find the joy in the search.</p>
