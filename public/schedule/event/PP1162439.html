  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As authoritarian regimes from Beijing to Tehran expand digital control through AI-powered surveillance, censorship algorithms, and language policing, free expression faces coordinated attack. These systems now share tools of repression across borders. In response, youth resist in whispers—through irony, creativity, and digital dexterity, they craft encrypted defiance. This panel explores how coded memes, subversive slang, guerrilla art, edgy rap lyrics and diaspora networks fuel encrypted defiance, reshaping protest through cracks in the digital firewall—online and on the ground.</p>

He joined the pro-democracy protests at age 17 during Thailand’s 2020 movement, as “the second wave” of the youth-led protest, advocating for constitutional reform, monarchy reform, and human rights. Angelo has spoken about the cultural shifts sparked by youth activism and the legal and political pressures faced by protestors. He envisions a democratic Thailand built on equality, truth, and reason, free from the cycles of conflict that shaped his generation.&quot;,
