  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As AI systems increasingly shape society, how do we ensure they truly serve everyone and don’t further encode societal biases? This structured workshop brings together community members to explore inclusive red teaming: a practice that probes generative AI models for bias and harm. Participants will learn what inclusive red teaming is, co-create prompts rooted in lived experience, contribute to an open-source prompt library, and connect with others who want to see a shared ownership of AI accountability. Let’s break things together—thoughtfully and equitably.</p>
