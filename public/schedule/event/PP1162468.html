  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Chasing one of the most ambitious scientific discoveries of our time, a group of biologists, linguists, roboticists, &amp; legal scholars have joined forces to understand what animals are saying to each other &amp; devise a way to talk to them. Leveraging state-of-the-art technology, including a groundbreaking machine learning engine, Project CETI scientists have made huge progress decoding the communication of sperm whales. We will explore the impact of interspecies communication &amp; what it means for humanity, the legal rights of animals, animal intelligence, and the future of conservation.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;David Gruber is the Founder &amp;amp; CEO of Project CETI (Cetacean Translation Initiative), a nonprofit organization as well as a National Geographic Society program that brings together over 50 scientists across eight disciplines to translate the communication of sperm whales. CETI has made pioneering scientific discoveries such as the elucidation of the sperm whale phonetic alphabet and sperm whale vowels.\n\nCETI’s vision is that these findings applied across species to exemplify how technology deepens human connection and motivation to protect the natural world. Gruber fostered the CETI - NYU School of Law’s “More Than Human Life” (MOTH) program collaboration. Together CETI and MOTH have published a futuristic legal article (What if We Understood What Animals Are Saying? The Legal Impact of AI-Assisted Studies of Animal Communication) that maps the potential impact for CETI’s findings on protections for whales and other lifeforms. CETI also conducts youth education and arts initiatives in Dominica, where its core research takes place, as well as global storytelling and arts initiatives.\n\nGruber is also Distinguished Professor of Biology and Environmental Sciences at the City University of New York and has been a National Geographic Explorer since 2014. His two decades of research before CETI, focused on climate, coral reef and deep ocean science. His laboratory invented technologies to perceive the underwater world from the perspective of marine animals, such as the “shark-eye-camera.” &quot;,
