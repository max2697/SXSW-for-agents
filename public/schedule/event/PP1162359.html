  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As our industry faces the death of monoculture and an increasingly fragmented landscape, it’s time for marketers to move beyond single moments or campaigns and build larger, expansive Worlds. This fireside chat will explore how brands and marketers can leverage different communities (and what it means to be a community insider), drive greater ongoing consumer engagement and loyalty, and explore rich insights when we look at Worlds through a local lens. As part of that, we’ll share Worldbuilding examples of brands steeped in culture, including the award-winning Vaseline Verified campaign.</p>
