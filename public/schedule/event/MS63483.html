  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Born and raised in San Diego’s surf-rock scene, Sun Room went from getting their house shows shut down for playing too loudly to selling out venues across a dozen countries. Formed in 2021, the band gained viral attention after two songs featured on Netflix’s Outer Banks. Expanding beyond their hometown, they sold out U.S. shows, supported Louis Tomlinson, toured Europe with Inhaler, and headlined their first North American tour in fall 2022, selling over 15,000 tickets. In spring 2023, Sun Room toured North America with Inhaler before returning to SoCal to finish At Least I Tried, which earned widespread acclaim.

In summer 2025, Sun Room released their latest EP, Ritual of Chaos, before supporting Flipturn and embarking on a 20+ date headline tour. The project showcases the band’s love of blues-rock, shoegaze and post-punk garage influences absorbed from playing worldwide. Their live show channels the energy of their early San Diego house shows - bigger and more electrifying with every performance. 

Sun Room continues to push their sound, explore new cities, and draw inspiration from their experiences. Their highly anticipated debut album is set for release in early 2026.</p>
