  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Irish/Brighton-based artist Sarah Crean is an indie-pop singer-songwriter whose music combines emotional clarity with layered, melodic arrangements. Her 2023 EP Death by Laundry featured the breakout single “2:00am,” now streamed over 7.5 million times on Spotify, and earned support from BBC Introducing, BBC Radio 1, The Line of Best Fit, Clash, Nialler9, and Spotify editorial playlists. The first single from her upcoming album, “22 Angel,” has already reached 80,000 streams and was featured on New Pop UK.

Sarah has toured the UK supporting acts including Florence Road, U.S. Girls, and Bombay Bicycle Club, with highlights such as a performance at the O2 Forum London alongside CMAT. Now independent and on the verge of her debut album - created entirely by women and inspired by the myth of Calypso - Crean explores heartbreak, home, and everything in between. With the album due mid-2026, she is emerging as one of alt-indie pop’s most compelling new voices.</p>
