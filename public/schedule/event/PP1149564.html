  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Immigration is a contentious and tumultuous topic these days. But the contributions of global talent are clear: Immigrants make up only 15% of the U.S. population, but 40% of Nobel science laureates and 44% of tech unicorn founders. Tom Zhang made his way from a small town in rural China to an Ivy League PhD and an Austin-based robotics startup. Doug Rand has helped global talent navigate the immigration system as a senior government official, co-founder of Boundless, and now head of a philanthropic fund. While many recent immigration policies may create obstacles for global founders, there are still several viable pathways to obtain a visa and start a company in the U.S. Come learn how America can remain the top destination for great immigrant entrepreneurs.</p>
