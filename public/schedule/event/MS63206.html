  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>At just 23, Cardiff-born singer-songwriter Ben Ellis has become one of the UK’s most quietly magnetic new voices, blending intimate acoustic songwriting with the emotional depth of indie-pop. His upcoming third EP marks a pivotal moment both emotionally and musically. Written across two trips to Los Angeles in the aftermath of a breakup, the project explores the complexities of heartbreak, drifting between moments of clarity and confusion.

“There was so much love still there,” Ellis says. “It’s crazy how art kind of comes from those moments.” Lead single “Where She Goes” emerged from a journal entry written the day after the breakup.

From there, the EP grew into a layered and collaborative body of work. Tracks like “When It Ends” push into rock territory with biting guitars, while “Animal” leans into warm, ’70s-inspired folk textures reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac. Co-produced by Grammy-nominated Matt Rad and longtime collaborator James October, the sessions saw Ellis push himself creatively, from late-night listens to Damien Rice to recording live drums at LA’s legendary Studio 606.</p>
