  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>congratulations are a hall of mirrors party troop. they are devils and tarts in equal measure. they lock their horns and then spin round and round and round until dizzy cacophony erupts. sugarcane hooks vs. slaughterhouse screams. taut, fizzing guitars &amp; caustic electronics nipping at the heels of huge fuzz bass &amp; booming percussive grooves. leah is the green one. jamie is dressed in blue. greg’s red, james is yellow. they’re here to move you.

Bursting onto the scene with a kinetic new sound, congratulations have quickly garnered a reputation for their raw energy, tight instrumentation and electrifying live performances. With punchy melodies and infectious hooks, congratulations deliver a mix of anthemic and experimental sounds fusing art-rock, garage, synth-pop and post-punk. The band’s lyrics explore themes of modern life, love, and self-discovery, delivered with a compelling honesty and emotion. congratulations’ fresh take on familiar sounds has earned them critical acclaim and a devoted and rapidly-growing fanbase, positioning them as one of the UK’s most exciting up-and-coming acts.

Signed to Bella Union records, with the bands debut album &quot;Join Hands&quot; due for release on February 13th. 

Having gained support previously from BBC Radio 1 and BBC 6Music including a live session for 6Music for Marc Riley.  Previous supporters of congratulations include Iggy Pop, Craig Charles, Nick Grimshaw, Chris Hawkins and Jess Izzatt.</p>
