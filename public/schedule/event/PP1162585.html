      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;🎬 Creative Executive | Producer | Innovation Strategist\n\n🔁 Bridging Storytelling, Technology, and the Future of Production\n\nI&#39;m Tom Thudiyanplackal — a producer, creative technologist, and former Bollywood development exec (3 Idiots) now leading frontier cinematic R&amp;amp;D at USC&#39;s Entertainment Technology Center and School of Cinematic Arts. My work focuses on developing the next generation of storytelling pipelines, including virtual production, AI-assisted workflows, and scalable tools that enhance creative ambition.\n\nAt USC, I serve as Executive Producer for Europa, ChikaBOOM!, The Bends, and Pathways — four short-form productions that explore the creative and ethical dimensions of AI, immersive media, and production labor transformation. I also mentor MFA and PhD filmmakers through the Amazon-funded Future Cinema Creators Project, helping shape how new voices engage with disruptive technologies.\n\nMy white paper for Fathead (Amazon Stage 15) became a widely referenced guide for studios adopting real-time production. I speak regularly at NAB, SIGGRAPH, and AI on the Lot, and collaborate with innovators like Google, Promise Studios, Asteria, Moon Valley, and Topaz Labs to rethink what filmmaking can be.\n\n💡 My mission: Build systems where story and computation evolve together — ethically, artistically, and exponentially.\n\n🌱 Currently building the future of trust-enabled, values-based, and human-centered entertainment at Forever Halcyon [dot] com.&quot;,
