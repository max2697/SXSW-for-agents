      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Stella Offner is a Professor at the University of Texas at Austin and is the Director of the NSF-Simons AI Institute for Cosmic Origins (CosmicAI). Her research explores how stars form by combining computer models, telescope observations, and statistical techniques. Her work aims to develop methods to effectively use AI to analyze astronomy data and predict properties that cannot be directly observed, work that is supported by funding from NASA, NSF, and the Simons Foundation.  Dr. Offner is the recipient of an NSF Early Career Award and a Cottrell Scholar Award. Her research has been published in Science and Nature and featured in a variety of articles in the popular press, including the Washington Post, Forbes, Science Daily, the BBC and many others.\n&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Dr. Paul Torrey is Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Virginia and Co‑Principal Investigator of the NSF–Simons AI Institute for Cosmic Origins (CosmicAI). He earned his Ph.D. in Astrophysics from Harvard and completed postdoctoral work at MIT and Caltech before serving on the faculty at the University of Florida. His research centers on theoretical investigations of galaxy formation and evolution. Paul has contributed to the development of major large‑scale cosmological simulations that follow the Universe&#39;s evolution from shortly after the Big Bang to the present day, providing crucial tests of galaxy formation models.&quot;,
