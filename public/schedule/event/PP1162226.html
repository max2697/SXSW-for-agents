  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Pop culture isn&#39;t just consumed—it&#39;s lived. A song or movie will spark IRL activity like themed workouts, sold-out dining experiences or fan meetups (e.g. Love Island events +4,950% in the past year). This shift from passive watching to active gathering reshapes culture and moves people–physically. Fandoms are inspiring creator-led experiences, turning local spaces into cultural venues overnight. In this panel Julia Hartz (Eventbrite), Dani Calogera (What/If), Kate Wolff (Lupine Creative) &amp; David Salazar (Fast Company) explore how pop culture becomes a springboard for real connection.</p>
