  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>In today’s content landscape, creators aren’t just making videos—they’re building universes. Long-form, narrative-driven programming is emerging as a way for creators to tell richer stories while incorporating brands in ways that feel natural and engaging. Creators aren’t just starring in the content—they’re producing the :15 and :30 ads that live across the platform. This session explores how creators can develop authentic brand partnerships that align with their vision, scale their careers, and transform one-off deals into long-term relationships built on trust, creativity, and shared values. Attendees will hear directly from top creators about why these deep partnerships are redefining how modern audiences connect with advertising that values authenticity and substance over surface-level promotion.</p>
