  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Games aren’t just translated, they’re co-created with local communities from day one. This panel pulls back the curtain on how global hits come to life across markets without losing their soul. Hear behind-the-scenes stories on how early local insights fuel global growth, how culturally meaningful in-game experiences with players across regions drive deeper worldwide engagement, and how partnerships with regional hubs are building a global pipeline of creative talent. Nika will share a clear four-step framework to make culture and community central to game development, from concept to launch.</p>
