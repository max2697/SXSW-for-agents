  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Pei-Yu Hung is a Taiwanese vocalist and multidisciplinary performer whose work bridges pop, performance art, and contemporary theater. Born in Kaohsiung and based in Taipei, she approaches music through a “body-based performance” philosophy, integrating dance, voice, and visual storytelling to expand the expressive range of modern pop. Her collaborations span independent musicians, theater troupes, and experimental artists, making her one of Taiwan’s most versatile and forward-thinking performers.

In 2022, Pei-Yu released her debut album ‘Silver Lining’ , a ten-track journey through light and shadow, personal reflection, and emotional subtlety. The album earned eight nominations at the Golden Melody Awards, winning Best New Artist. In 2023, her song “The Same” (同款), the theme for the film ‘Day Off’ won Best Original Film Song at the Golden Horse Awards. 

Widely regarded as one of the most accomplished female vocalists in the Mandarin-speaking music scene over the past decade, Pei-Yu Hung continues to define contemporary Mandarin-language music with her distinctive voice and artistry. Seamlessly moving between lyrical pop and avant-garde soundscapes, she merges experimentation with expressive depth, redefining contemporary Mandarin music and bringing a bold, fresh dimension of Taiwanese sound to the global stage. 

Pei-Yu released her highly anticipated second album ‘Still Moving’ in October 2025, featuring collaborations with artists from Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore. For the new single “It&#39;s Nothing Personal”,  she enlisted Polish director Chris Rudz, who previously directed dance videos for Japanese artist Fujii Kaze, to helm the music video, with choreography created in collaboration with Japanese choreographer Chikako Takemoto, showcasing a dynamic cross-border, cross-disciplinary creative energy.</p>
