  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The panel brings together artists using immersive tools — from AR and AI to dance and gaming — to explore how we can reimagine archives, reclaim erased histories, and create portals into the past and future. Each of us approaches this through different mediums, but with a shared urgency around memory, embodiment, and speculative technology. The idea is to explore how immersive practices can act as a kind of time travel: allowing us to move through historical absence and presence, remix narratives, and build alternate realities where marginalized voices take center stage.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Stephanie Dinkins is a transdisciplinary artist exploring the intersections of emerging technologies, race, and social justice. Through immersive installations, AI-driven storytelling, and community engagement, she challenges dominant narratives and builds new frameworks for technological equity.
