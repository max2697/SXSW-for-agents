  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>CDSM a.k.a. Celebrity Death Slot Machine is a “freakout post-punk group” (FLOOD Magazine) based in Atlanta, GA. Their stylish sonic onslaught is anchored around dancey rhythms, atypical synthesizer work, timely saxophone growls, as well as goth rock-esque melodies that serve to recount bizarre humor-laden tales from a derelict parallel universe. Since forming in 2021, the band has toured North America and Europe, sharing the stage with likes of The KVB, Bodega, Sheer Mag, Iceage, and Model/Actriz, while also taking part in events such as SXSW, Treefort Festival, Art Rock Festival, Hopscotch Festival, and M for Montreal. CDSM’s introductory EP, Hell Stairs (2022), was both glamorous and bleak, swanky and derelict, uplifting and crushing, described by the band as “hedonism clinking in your glass, change jingling in the pit of your chest.” Atlanta’s hot new commodity followed with a slew of music videos – “GOGO” (May 11th, 2023), “Entertainment” (2023), “DOM” (2023), and “SHADY” (2024) – amidst a stretch that saw them bring their sweaty live set to the very best underground venues the United States, Canada and Europe have to offer.</p>
