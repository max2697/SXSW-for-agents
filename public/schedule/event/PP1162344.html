  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>What if the traits you need to succeed are the exact opposite of what you’ve been told? 

To get ahead, you need to be Weird, Selfish, Shameless, Obsessed, Nosy, Manipulative, Brutal, Reckless, and Bossy. And that takes courage. 

NYT bestselling author and former Google exec Jenny Wood offers a bold, tactical playbook to ditch fear—of failure, uncertainty, and judgment by others—and apply these nine eyebrow-raising traits in a sane and savvy way to go after what you want and get it, whether you’re trying to snag a stretch promotion, impress your new boss, or land a life-changing deal.</p>
