  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>‘The Family Battenberg have perfected a filthy, fuzzy psychedelic sound that they’ve coined as “spider rock.” (The Face)
The Family Battenberg&#39;s &#39;Anteater&#39; single, released in April 2025, is an independent release by the Cardiff based four-piece. The track was written in just a day, and it was recorded at Tom Rees’ (Buzzard Buzzard Buzzard) studio while he was on holiday. To master the recording the group sought out long-time collaborator Eddie Al-Shakarchi (Boy Azooga, Loathe, Swim Deep.)

Aligning with the soundscape that’s signature to them, ‘Anteater’ is The Family Battenberg finessed. Drenched in fuzzy saturation, spacey vocals ricochet between a blistering guitar, all while a double-tracked mono drum plays like a call to action.  This is an anti-love song. When unhealthy adoration becomes a quest for romance, or approval in this case, we find ourselves doing strange things. In this story, the protagonist justifies total metamorphosis in the name of subservience. “It’s self-humiliation in the pursuit of a potential suitor’s attention,” as frontman Eliot puts it. Anyone that has seen this band live before is sure to recognise it from past setlists. The group had played it as an unreleased track amongst their own shows and a host of major festivals, namely,

Greenman, Trans Musicales 2024, Reeperbahn 2024 and ESNS 2025. As budding upcomers, the group have also supported the likes of Getdown Services, Panic Shack, Gruff Rhys and the Bug Club.

Championed by Steve Lamacq, Amy Lame, Huw Stephens and Adam Walton, the group are already making their mark on the industry.
