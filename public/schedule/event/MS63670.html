  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Jordan Walsh is a percussionist, producer, and educator based in Austin, Texas. A proponent of electronics and theater in music, he strives to perform the most absurd music with the most genuine fervor. Jordan&#39;s recent work includes esteemed composers including Elainie Lillios, Aida Shirazi, José Martinez, and Louis Raymond Kolker. Frequently engaged as a solo performer, Jordan has appeared at the SEAMUS conference, the New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, Percussive Arts Society International Convention, New Music Dublin, and the Bowling Green State University New Music Festival.

Jordan currently serves as principal percussionist for the Density512 new music collective, is a member of minimalist metal group Goliath Was Bigfoot, acts as the sometimes third part of the legendary Line Upon Line Percussion, and is one half of the live-only-nonbroadcast-pirate-radio phenomenon Peach Blossom Highway. When he is not engaged with contemporary classical music, he can be found playing drums with Austin Bands including Maru Haru and Middle Sattre. Jordan proudly endorses Pearl/Adams Percussion, Sabian Cymbals, Black Swamp Percussion, and Innovative Percussion.</p>
