  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>When Jack Dorsey tweeted “Delete all IP law” and Elon Musk agreed, the music biz thought it was just provocative nonsense. But next thing you know, Trump fired the Register of Copyrights after she said AI companies need to pay up for music they&#39;re ingesting. Then music companies pivoted from suing AI platforms to making big deals with them. So what gives? Is copyright law too restrictive or even unnecessary? Mozart didn&#39;t need it to make music. Sure, but Mozart died penniless.  A wise and experienced panel will explore both sides of this heated and fascinating issue, and keep it high level.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Peter Anderson has over four decades of experience in copyright and entertainment litigation. He was lead counsel in the \&quot;Stairway to Heaven\&quot; music copyright case, representing Led Zeppelin and others, winning a jury verdict that held on appeal (Skidmore v. Led Zeppelin). His current or past clients also include, for example, Taylor Swift, the Weeknd, Cardi B, Mariah Carey, Miley Cyrus, Green Day, Sam Smith, Cher, Lil Nas X, Korn, and Ozzy Osbourne, as well as the major record companies and music publishers. Peter successfully argued to the U.S. Supreme Court in the all-important \&quot;Rear Window\&quot; copyright case (Stewart v Abend), which continues to govern how copyrights can be recaptured by authors and musicians who signed them away decades earlier. \n&quot;,
