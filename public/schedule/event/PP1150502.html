      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Platinum-selling songwriter and producer Sarah Nagourney is a singular creative voice whose work bridges emotional depth with commercial impact. Known for helping artists shape songs that feel both intimate and timeless, Nagourney has become a trusted collaborator across pop, alternative, and beyond, bringing originality, instinct, and lived experience to every project she touches.\rOxford-educated and fiercely authentic, Nagourney’s songwriting is informed by a life lived well outside the studio. Her path has included singing with jazz legend Chet Baker, appearing in Woody Allen films, working as a private investigator, and living in Andy Warhol’s former Factory. These unconventional experiences fuel a lyrical perspective that is observant, cinematic, and grounded in truth—qualities that consistently set her work apart in a trend-driven industry.\r \r \r\rNagourney has written with a veritable who’s who of the music world, including Steve Booker (Duffy, Nick Jonas), Larzz Principato (Halsey), Liam O’Donnell (The Chainsmokers, Fall Out Boy), Chris Rodriguez (Wynonna Judd), Brian Kierulf (Lady Gaga), Polina Goudieva (Felix Jaehn, Eminem), Steve Diamond (Eric Clapton, Britney Spears), Steve Daly (Pink, JLS), Jasper Leak (Sia), Phil Thornalley (The Cure, Bryan Adams), Southside Johnny, and Chris Difford of Squeeze. Her ability to meet artists where they are—while pushing them creatively—has made her a sought-after collaborator across continents.\r \r \r\rIn recent years, Nagourney has remained creatively prolific, writing regularly in London, Los Angeles, Nashville, and New York, and collaborating with both established and emerging artists including Emma Rae, Isabella Dussias, Charlie Brennan, Isabella Kensington, and Charlie Mindich. Her work also includes writing with managing and developing young talent, notably Meg Smith—whose breakout releases have amassed tens of millions of streams—and Alec Chambers, reflecting a long-term commitment to artist development alongside commercial success. Her work has amassed tens of millions of streams, with placements across major streaming platforms, television, and high-profile editorial playlists, while also contributing to long-term artist development and award-winning outcomes. \r \r\rBeyond songwriting, Nagourney is the creator and host of She Creates Noise, a bi-monthly podcast centered on women working across the music industry. Launched in 2025 and now entering Season 2, the podcast offers listeners an honest, behind-the-scenes look at how the music business truly works. Through intimate, one-on-one conversations with women on both sides of the desk—from artists and producers to managers and label executives—Nagourney shifts the narrative away from obstacles and toward excellence, leadership, and impact. Featured guests include Kate Hyman (former VP at BMG, Warner, and Chrysalis), Rachael Yamagata, and other influential voices shaping the industry today. With She Creates Noise, Nagourney continues to amplify stories that deserve to be heard, using her platform to celebrate the women who are actively moving music forward.&quot;,
