  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Girl Tones, of planet Earth, are a high-energy rock duo brought to life by two sisters named Kenzie and Laila. Both classically trained musicians, Kenzie transitioned from cello to guitar and Laila from piano to drums in an effort to electrify sentient beings from this galaxy to the next. Their debut releases were produced by Brad Shultz of Cage The Elephant and released via his label Parallel Vision in partnership with Big Loud Rock.
Their first offerings have earned the praise of Rolling Stone, VICE, Consequence, PAPER, NME, DORK and many others with Flaunt saying, “Their sound is fluid, and yet with each release, they evolve as a harmonious group, developing their unique sound as one.”
Girl Tones has toured with Cage The Elephant across the globe, as well as The Velveteers, hey, nothing. and Silversun Pickups in North America. Making their unignorable festival debut at Lollapalooza, Shaky Knees, Austin City Limits and more, Rolling Stone said, “While the White Stripes — their most obvious comparison — were about controlled energy, Girl Tones are proudly imperfect.”
As the band jumps into 2026, they have no shortage of new music and new tour dates up their sleeves.</p>
