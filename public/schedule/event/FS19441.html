  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>When Rana’s visa application is denied, she faces the reality of returning home to Iran. That is, until Adam – her wealthy boss’s son and her summer fling – proposes a green card wedding. Wrestling with the implications of his offer, Rana enlists help from a questionable shaman, Adam’s pure-hearted mom, and most importantly her two Iranian best friends Nadia and Setareh, who arrive on Cape Cod for a wedding weekend full of opinions, chaos, and drama with their own American boyfriends. Just as total disaster approaches, the three women come together in a transformative moment of acceptance, growth, and coming of age – evolving this weekend into one that will change them all forever.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Lauren Noll is an L.A. based actor-director from the mountains of East Tennessee. Her feature\ndirectorial debut, SAME SAME BUT DIFFERENT, is a female-driven ensemble comedy\nhighlighting three women navigating the tensions of their cross-cultural relationships and the\npressures of modern life, friendship, and womanhood. It will premiere at SXSW 2026.\n\nHailing from a rich background in theatre, she earned her graduate degree in Acting at Harvard’s\nAmerican Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) and the Moscow Art Theatre (MXAT) before her focus\npivoted toward film. Lauren first stepped behind the camera with the short drama HONOR, an\nintimate, autobiographically inspired story about coming of age, coming out, and facing\nexpulsion from Brigham Young University. The film earned multiple awards and launched her\nnew path as a filmmaker. She followed this short debut with GEN V, which began an ongoing\ncreative partnership with actor-writer Dalia Rooni and secured the pair a development deal with\nAdi Shankar’s Bootleg Universe. The duo went on to make CLEAN SLATE, a recipient of the\nCollaborative Film Challenge Grand Jury Prize and a grant from Blackmagic Design, before\nembarking to make their first feature film SAME SAME BUT DIFFERENT together.\n\nMost recently, Lauren co-wrote and starred in the Oscar Qualified short film, THE HEART OF\nTEXAS, which screened at more than 75 festivals worldwide and earned Lauren a dozen acting\nawards on the festival circuit for her performance as Janie May, a down-on-her-luck country\nsinger caught between a last shot at her dream and the crushing responsibility she bears for\nanother dreamer she collides with on her path. Across all of her work, Lauren is drawn to\nintimate, character-driven stories about ordinary people searching for grace and meaning in\nchaotic worlds. Her love for actors and their craft is undeniably infused into her directing style.\nShe approaches each project with honesty, humor, and deep compassion, crafting stories that\nreveal the beauty and hilarity of being human.&quot;,
