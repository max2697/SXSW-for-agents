  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>With a name as regal as their ambition, KNO are reshaping boundaries as they set out to release their debut album in April 2026.

This charismatic trio built their reputation through relentless touring and a catalogue of singles that bristle with both confidence and vulnerability.

Glistening guitar riffs, punchy rhythms and poetic narratives ensure their sound is both urgent and heartfelt.

These narratives are channelled into lyrics that are as revealing as they are relatable.

The songwriting is a testament to their roots. Each track is a vignette of life, steeped in nostalgia, resilience and a yearning to belong. It’s music that’s as much about catharsis as it is about connection.

First single ‘Transgressions’ is a confessional anthem. Nostalgia and identity are painted vividly in the second single as the band retrace childhood, its warmth underpinning an unflinching honesty.

Yet it’s the title track which lies at the emotional heart of this debut. Empathy is portrayed as both gift and curse, a force that connects deeply to others’ pain, yet at times threatens to overwhelm.

It’s a debut album that’s as unguarded and unflinching as the band themselves, sure to resonate with anyone whose heart has ever felt too full.</p>
