  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As a bassist, vocalist, and composer, my journey as a music creator has been shaped by my rich cultural heritage and passion for blending traditional jazz with contemporary influences. I grew up in the suburbs of Paris, born to parents of Senegalese, Gambian, and Malian descent. This background continues to inspire my artistry, which merges the sounds of jazz legends like Betty Carter and Wayne Shorter with the soulful rhythms of artists such as D’Angelo and Stevie Wonder. 
 
Since moving to London at 18 to study double bass at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, I have built a strong live track record, performing at renowned festivals and venues including the EFG London Jazz Festival, Jazz Café, Cheltenham Jazz Festival, We Out Here, Brick Lane Jazz Festival, and Pizza Express Soho. These experiences have been pivotal in building my fanbase and establishing my presence in the UK. Internationally I have performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival and countries around the world including France, Poland , South Korea and more.</p>
