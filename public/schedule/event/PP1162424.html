  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Gaming is one of the largest forms of entertainment in the world &amp; the creator economy within it is rapidly expanding. A process that once prioritized creators with the largest audiences &amp; revenue streams has since evolved to working with a range of  creators, targeting those with the most engaged audiences. As the industries continue to grow &amp; scale each year, recruiting, managing, measuring &amp; tracking hundreds of creators can feel impossible, but it doesn’t have to. This panel explores how brands &amp; developers are building smart systems that fuel high-performing evergreen creator programs.</p>
