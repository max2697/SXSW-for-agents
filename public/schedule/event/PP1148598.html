      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Dr. Paul Campbell is a venture capitalist, serial entrepreneur, and federal innovation insider who operates at the intersection of startups, capital, and government. He is Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Brown Venture Group (BVG), a Minnesota-based VC firm investing in early-stage technology companies building the future. He is also co-founder and executive director of Federal Mashup Lab, a first of its kind public–private innovation engine that fast-tracks commercialization through a lean boot camp, helping founders license federal tech, access pro bono IP support, and de-risk their path to funding.\n\nBefore venture capital and Federal Mashup Lab, Paul founded startups in IoT and media production, was a music producer and ranked as a national top-10 technology sales executive, so he knows firsthand what it takes to build, sell, and scale. Today, he helps founders turn breakthrough technologies into venture-backable businesses.\n\nPaul also serves on the National Advisory Council for the Federal Laboratory Consortium (FLC) for Technology Transfer, where he works to bridge federal labs, industry, and entrepreneurs. His experience across NASA innovation initiatives and public-private partnerships gives him a rare, practical view into how government really works, and how founders can win inside it.\n\nAt SXSW, in “What’s the Catch? The Realities of Federal Contracting for Entrepreneurs,” Paul pulls back the curtain on federal contracting, sharing the opportunities, landmines, and strategic plays that can turn government complexity into serious competitive advantage.\n\nFeatured in Forbes, Bloomberg, Black Enterprise, and more, Paul brings real talk, real strategy, and real receipts.\n&quot;,
