  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>AI helps us work faster than ever—but are we sacrificing how we develop? In this live podcast, we discuss why metacognition—how we think, feel, and learn—is the human advantage when partnering with AI in our work. We’ll unpack how intentional thinking helps people decide when to offload to AI, when to lean in, and how to grow through the process. Expect practical insights, geeky discussions, and evidence-based strategies you can immediately apply to monitor, evaluate, and optimize your learning and working as AI increasingly influences our lives.</p>
