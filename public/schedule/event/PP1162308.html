  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Remember when every brand promised to do better? In 2020, diversity and inclusion roles were created overnight, corporate pledges made, and equity became a buzzword. Fast forward to now, when those diversity offices and leadership budgets are vanishing, and DEI programs face contact attacks. Where does that leave leaders—especially Black women—who were once vaunted as symbols of progress? Expect data, sharp insights, and real stories as we unpack what it takes to create systems where Black women’s leadership can thrive even when equity isn’t trending.</p>
