  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Join author Jesse Crosson for a special first-public reading of his forthcoming memoir,  (publishing March 10, 2026). In this session, Jesse will read select passages that dive into his journey and how the hard-won lessons he learned apply to your life as well! He will discuss how accountability is the pathway to freedom, how service is redemption in action and how building a life of options is much more successful than building a life of plans.

This is a rare chance to hear these stories live and unfiltered, straight from the place where transformation began. Pre-order the book now and be among the first to hear the journey from darkness to rebirth—on stage at SXSW.

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Jesse Crosson was incarcerated just after his 18th birthday and sentenced to serve 32 years in prison. It seemed like the end, but it was only the beginning.\n\nJesse turned his life around, graduated from Ohio University, helped start a peer support mental health program and eventually earned a conditional pardon from the Governor.\n\nAfter receiving the pardon, Crosson walked out into the world after 19 years of incarceration and hit the ground running. He exploded on social media and started Second Chancer Foundation to help bridge the gap between incarceration and opportunity.\n\nHis book, The Best Part of Prison is released March 10, 2026, and will have its debut reading at SXSW.\n\nJesse is passionate about helping people earn second chances and find freedom.&quot;,
