      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Renata Vichi is one of Brazil’s leading references in entrepreneurship. An executive, board member, and keynote speaker, she has built a career marked by strategic vision, strong execution capability, and consistent discipline over more than 30 years—beginning in her teenage years.\r\rThroughout this journey, she has led iconic brands in Brazilian retail, serving as CEO of Kopenhagen and founding Brasil Cacau. She spearheaded the expansion of Grupo CRM, taking the business to billion-revenue scale. She also served as an executive and CEO of a company controlled by a private equity fund, with a strong focus on governance, value creation, financial discipline, and strategic execution. She led high-impact decisions and complex processes of growth, professionalization, and succession, consolidating her reputation as one of the country’s most respected voices on leadership, strategy, branding, operational efficiency, and sustainable growth.\r\rShe also played a key role in the entry and consolidation of Lindt in Brazil, contributing to the adaptation of the specialized retail model in the country and leading the rollout of more than 55 stores between 2014 and 2020.\r\rHer career includes leadership of billion-dollar operations, a central role in family succession processes, close collaboration with investment funds, and strategic experience in a multinational environment with Nestlé—along with the execution of the largest deal ever completed in the segment in Brazil. She is recognized for building, strengthening, and rejuvenating century-old brands, always with strong emotional connection and high market value, and for her active presence as a leading female voice in the business world.\r\rAmong her highlights are a case study presented at Harvard on the expansion and consolidation of Grupo CRM, her featured role in the series Incansável aired on Meu Sucesso, authorship of the book Chocolate nas Veias, and her confirmed participation as a judge on the program Rota Fácil in February 2026.&quot;,
