  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Managing today feels like a trap: too much to do, too little trust, and no time to build relationships that make teams thrive. This provocative session draws on decades of experience with Fortune 50 executives and over 12,000 pages of interview data to reveal two surprising truths: pressure—not power—corrupts, and power creates distance. Left unchecked, both warp your best intentions. But when managed well, they can drive clarity, connection, and trust. You’ll leave with practical tools to rethink your role, reset your relationships, and lead with more impact.</p>
