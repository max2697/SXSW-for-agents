  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Future Nobodies is a genre-bending trio from Chicago, IL. Influenced by the 2000’s NYC indie scene as well as 1980’s post-punk and new wave, the band has developed a nostalgic,  emotionally charged sound that is solely their own. Often described as “sad happy music to dance to,” the trio croon like Morrissey over bass heavy melodies and crying guitar licks.
The band released their first album in 2021 (Hotel Del La Muerte) as an online project that gained immediate traction. In 2022 they released their Over it/Apasionada EP. “Over It” was placed on an official Spotify playlist causing the song to reach over a million streams and gain the band over 50K monthly listeners overnight. In 2023 they performed at Riot Fest. The line up included acts such as Death Cab For Cutie, Queens of the Stoneage, and The Cure. In 2024 they released their self-titled sophomore album, Future Nobodies. The album was picked up and distributed by Young &amp; Cold Records. With the record labels help, the band made their European debut at Germany’s annual Wave Gotik Treffen Festival. Since then, the band has gained underground popularity and is currently touring cities across the U.S.</p>
