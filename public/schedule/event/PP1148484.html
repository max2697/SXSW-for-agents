  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Forget hype cycles. The real story of 2026 is bigger, stranger, and closer than you imagine. At SXSW, futurist Amy Webb, CEO of the Future Today Strategy Group and professor at NYU Stern, will take you on a mind-bending exploration of the forces reshaping business, culture, and society. With her signature wit and data-driven approach, Amy will decode the emerging technologies that demand your attention and reveal scenarios that challenge how we think about the future. If you’ve joined Amy’s packed sessions in past years, you know to expect startling insights, big shifts in perspective, and ideas you’ll be talking about long after the session ends. This year, though, there’s a twist you won’t see coming—one that could change the way we track, understand, and act on trends forever. The theme is Creative Destruction. While there&#39;s no official dress code for the session, we do recommend you wear black.</p>
