  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The international music business is far larger and more lucrative than many expect – just look at the broad worldwide impact of LATAM artists like Bad Bunny and K-Pop groups like BTS. The question is, how does an artist from these regions and beyond achieve this kind of success? The answer lies with music distributors, marketers, and data analysts, who have the tools to break talented artists both in their home countries and around the world. In this panel, experts will explain which resources and team members artists should bring onboard to generate international interest, and when.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Mark J. Feist is a multi-platinum producer, songwriter, and music executive, and the Founder &amp;amp; CEO of Hitmakers Entertainment. His career spans more than three decades across global markets, contributing to 35M+ records sold and hundreds of millions of streams worldwide. He has written and produced for Beyoncé, Destiny’s Child, Mary J. Blige, Kelly Rowland, Céline Dion, John Legend, Natalie Cole, George Clinton, Tyga, The Game, and others. Feist began composing commercially at 13, achieved his first international success at 18, and by his mid-20s had delivered more than 40 gold and platinum albums across Asia before relocating permanently to Los Angeles. His U.S. breakthrough came with “I Love You” (MCA) for Keith Washington and Chanté Moore, followed by extensive major-label work throughout the 1990s and 2000s. In 2016, Feist founded Hitmakers Entertainment in response to structural weaknesses in the modern label model. He shifted from hit-driven execution to building artist ecosystems engineered for the post-streaming era—prioritizing catalog depth, ownership, algorithmic confidence, and repeat listener behavior over ad spend, radio dependency, or forced virality. Feist is the architect behind the complete ecosystem of recording artist Tash, whom he signed at 15 and developed over seven years. That ecosystem includes 83 released masters (with 100 future masters under contract), full master ownership, co-publishing participation, touring and merch participation, owned playlist infrastructure, and a global UGC-driven discovery engine across Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, Instagram, and TikTok—built to scale organically without paid media. &quot;,
