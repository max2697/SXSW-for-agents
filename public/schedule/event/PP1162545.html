  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As AI agents begin to discover, recommend, and even purchase on behalf of consumers, the traditional path to purchase is being upended.

We’ll examine the infrastructure enabling these agents, the implications for brand visibility and trust, and how marketers, platforms, and technologists must adapt to stay relevant when AI shops for us.</p>
