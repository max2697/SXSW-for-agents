  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Libraries are books and so much more! We will spotlight how public and national libraries are launchpads for emerging tech, from AI to XR, while staying rooted in community trust and accessibility. Hear from library innovators and creative technologists co-creating inclusive spaces for play, learning, and critical tech discourse. We’ll explore libraries bridging the gap between innovation and equity, and how YOU can partner with them to build meaningful, community-driven projects. Expect a lively conversation that challenges assumptions, shares real-world collaborations, and sparks new ideas.</p>
