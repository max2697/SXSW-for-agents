  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As AI transforms climate education with personalized learning and interactive simulations, we face an uncomfortable truth: the data centers powering these solutions are driving massive energy consumption that threatens to undermine our climate goals. With data center electricity use projected to double by 2030, how do we justify using energy-intensive AI to teach climate solutions? We&#39;ll examine real trade-offs, share concrete solutions, and propose a path toward AI-powered climate education that helps rather than harms our environmental future.</p>
