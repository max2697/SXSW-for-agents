  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Adult DVD, the Leeds based six piece have become known for their relentless output of euphoric hooks and grooves along with a relentless touring schedule that has taken them to Glastonbury, Greenman, End Of The Road and several European festivals this Summer.
Formed by vocalist Harry Hanson and synth-player Greg Lonsdale, the project quickly expanded to a full band with Danny Blackburn (guitar/synth), Jake Williams (synth), Jonathan Newell (drums), and George Manson (bass). From the outset, their tongue-in-cheek lyrics, pulsating electronics, big choruses and unique production style (their releases are all self-produced) set them apart from the indie-rock landscape. 
Few songs capture the chaotic fun of Adult DVD more than their first release ‘Bill Murray’ - now a firm fan favourite and sing along moment at every festival set. First ‘proper’ single ‘Do Something’ from their &#39;Next Day Shipping&#39; EP earned a spot on the BBC 6 Music B-list and support from BBC Radio 1, BBC Introducing and Radio X. Subsequent single ‘Because I Like It’ also landed onto the 6 Music B-list, and accompanying live performance from the BBC’s 6 Music festival.
Adult DVD’s live shows are fast becoming legendary. From sold-out hometown headline gigs at Brudenell Social Club and Belgrave Music Hall (2 in the round shows in one day) to storming sets at The Great Escape, Deer Shed Festival, and Live at Leeds, their performances are high-energy and unmissable.
Whether tapping into their love for chorus-centric indie or the influence of acid house floor fillers, DJing, or remixing their musical contemporaries their core appeal remains consistent: undeniable humour, bold danceable instrumentals and instantly memorable songwriting.&quot;</p>
