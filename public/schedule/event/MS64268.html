  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Formed in the orbit of a South London pub, the spirit of Mên An Tol’s music can be traced back to frontman Bill Jefferson’s own musical education in his native Cornwall where he’d play folk sessions in and around the local pubs – in-fact the band name itself is taken from a rural site of ancient stones.

The band’s instant chemistry (completed by mandolinist Felix Knox, bassist Max Silvey, drummer Tom Stevens and guitarist Robert Wiseman) is writ-large as they channel the raw grit of folk greats like The Pogues and The Waterboys alongside the mainstage urgency and confidence of Britpop giants. Perhaps most vitally, the songs proudly reclaim lost folk traditions with the use of the mandolin coupled with vibrant storytelling.

The band released two EP&#39;s in 2025, the most recent being September&#39;s &#39;This Land’, featuring the track ‘Not Ideal’ - produced by Carlos O’Connell of Fontaines DC who got involved after seeing them live. 

Throughout the year Mên An Tol have gone from strength to strength. They&#39;ve picked up praise from NME, Rolling Stone UK, The Independent, DIY, So Young and more. At radio the band were on the B List at BBC 6 Music with single &#39;Not Ideal&#39; and recorded a Maida Vale session for Steve Lamacq. On his Apple Music radio show Elton John has given two different tracks a spin, stating &quot;I really love their sound&quot;. 

The band played two shows at 2025 Glastonbury Festival alongside European festival runs, UK touring and dates supporting The Libertines and Miles Kane. They also played The Great Escape and finished the year with a packed out London headline at The Lexington.</p>
