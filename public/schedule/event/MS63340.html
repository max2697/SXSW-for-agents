  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Werkha (aka Tom Leah) is a multi-instrumentalist, producer &amp; DJ hailing from Manchester and Cumbria. He has been consistently releasing music and creating live experiences for over a decade. Werkha’s music fuses analogue jazz-funk vibes with the UK’s electronic, resulting in a number of releases nestled between the sounds of broken beat and cinematic moments. Deep synths and delectable drums ride alongside live horns and a wealth of string textures. Shortly after his track “Sidesteppin” was picked up by Gilles Peterson for his Brownswood Bubblers compilation, Werkha’s debut landed on the acclaimed Brighton imprint Tru Thoughts. He went on to sign to the Worldwide Award-winning First Word Records, releasing his self-produced sophomore album ‘All Werk Is Play’ in 2022. This featured collabs with MC Chunky (Eglo Records / Swamp 81), Ellen Beth Abdi (A Certain Ratio), Kemani Anderson (Secret Night Gang), Nick Blacka (GoGo Penguin) and Tom Driessler (Tom Misch / Jordan Rakei) amongst others. 
 
His vibrant energetic live shows include a selection of instruments, looped and fused with a mix of tightly packed samples that set the moment alight, blending beauty and dance.</p>
