  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>For too long, health care has focused on treating diseases after symptoms appear and they have already taken hold. That is what we call “sick care.” Lilly is working to change that by moving to true “health care” where diseases are found earlier, treated sooner and in some cases prevented altogether.​Lilly is already bringing this vision to life with breakthroughs like improving how we manage chronic conditions and extend healthy years, moving earlier in brain diseases, restoring senses with genetic medicines and harnessing the immune system in powerful new ways. </p>
