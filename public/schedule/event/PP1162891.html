      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Jon Levy is a behavioral scientist and NY Times Best Selling author known for his work in trust, leadership, and team intelligence. When results matter, Jon gets the call. \n\nLevy specializes in applying the latest research to transform the ways people and organizations approach the way they build trust and work together. His clients range from Fortune 500 brands, like Microsoft, Google, AB-InBev, and Samsung, to startups.\n\nFifteen years ago, Levy founded The Influencers Dinner, a secret dining experience for industry leaders ranging from Nobel laureates, Olympians, celebrities, and executives, to artists, musicians, and even the Grammy-winning voice of the bark from “Who Let the Dogs Out.” Guests cook dinner together but can’t discuss their careers or give their last names. Once seated to eat, they reveal who they are. Over time, these dinners developed into a community. With thousands of members, Influencers is the largest community of its type worldwide.\n\nJon’s second book, You’re Invited, was released to critical acclaim, quickly rising as a New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and international best seller. In it, Levy demonstrates the value of trust, connection, and community in accomplishing what is most important to us.\n\nHis third book, Team Intelligence: How Brilliant Leaders Unlock Collective Genius, demystifies the science of leadership and the habits that make teams more than the sum of their parts. \n\nIn his free time, Jon works on outrageous projects. Among them, spending a year traveling to all 7 continents, or to the world&#39;s greatest events (Grand Prix, Art Basel, Burning Man, Running of the Bulls, etc.) and barely surviving to tell the tale. These Adventures were chronicled in his first book: The 2 AM Principle: Discover the Science of Adventure\n&quot;,
