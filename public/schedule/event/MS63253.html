  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Dubbed “UK music’s best kept secret” (Clash UK), drummer and producer Mackwood is rapidly emerging as one of the most exciting voices in the new wave of UK jazz and beyond. Cutting his teeth with Col3trane, Jim Legacy and ELIZA, and coming up through crossover projects like Silhouettes Project and Levitation Orchestra, Mackwood has carved out a distinctive niche between progressive jazz, beatmaking and alternative dancefloor rhythms. His sound fuses the pedigree of UK and international jazz with London’s new generation of player-producers, continuing the UK’s celebrated tradition of boundary-breaking crossover.

Now stepping into the spotlight with his debut album MASTER CHANGES, he is cementing his reputation as a forward-thinking artist with global reach. With roots in jazz but a sound that bridges hip hop, electronic and bass culture, Mackwood’s music crosses scenes and audiences alike. His collaborations span both acclaimed names and rising talent, while his live energy and versatility are fast building him a worldwide reputation.</p>
