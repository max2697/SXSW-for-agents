  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The weaponization of NDAs is a core structural feature of the economy that shapes corporate culture. Using cases from My NDA (World Premiering at SXSW 2026), panelists will expose how NDAs are used to protect brands; enable discrimination, harassment, and corruption to go unchecked; and destroy the careers of whistleblowers who risk everything to speak out. Panelists (including two anonymous participants of the film) will also discuss what an ethical NDA looks like and the simple legislative fixes that can solve this problem.</p>
