  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>AI is quietly but profoundly changing how people think, act, and decide. From planning trips to seeking therapy, it’s quickly becoming the first stop for answers and everyday decision-making. It’s also reshaping cognition: one MIT study found that frequent ChatGPT users reported higher loneliness and reduced critical thinking over time. This session brings together behavioral experts, cognitive researchers and marketers to explore how AI is rewiring consumer behavior, and how brands can keep up.</p>
