  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>EMI ANGELES is a trap artist born in Mexico City and raised in Nuevo León, whose music emerges from a deep creative and spiritual duality. His name comes from the abbreviation of José Emiliano Angeles Aguado and his strong connection to the Catholic faith, a constant pillar within his identity. His project is built around two alter egos: CRVZ, which embodies madness, contained rage, and raw energy, and Ángeles, his more human, sensitive, and everyday side. Influenced by Detroit trap, hood trap, and artists such as Playboi Carti, Ye, and Abhir, EMI ANGELES delivers an authentic and daring sound designed to send chills through the body, shake emotions, and leave a lasting imprint on the listener. His first encounter with music came at an early age after discovering Michael Jackson, leading him from dance to songwriting and eventually to the microphone. Key moments such as his EP ALTER/EGO and the loss of his best friend marked a turning point in his journey, solidifying his artistic commitment. Today, EMI ANGELES transforms the unknown into experience, creating music that connects with what many are afraid to name, aiming to leave a lasting legacy within the Mexican trap scene.</p>
