  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Some campaigns are known less for what they communicated, and more for how people responded. The social media loudspeaker helps people out-shout brands – and the anticipation of backlash is essential for smart marketers. Backlash is a new stage of the “consumer journey” when any brand decides to assert its values. Part discussion, part crisis simulation, learn to strategize and create for a world where consumers choose the division brands seek to surmount. Steel your values, weather undesired turbulence, and emerge as a business with integrity and advantage.</p>
