      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Ansa Cobham is a postdoctoral researcher in the Rohner laboratory at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research. Her research investigates the molecular basis of metabolic adaptation using the cavefish model Astyanax mexicanus. This unique organism offers a novel system to uncover compensatory mechanisms that could lead to new treatment targets for metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Additionally, Cobham is developing an innovative research program that leverages this model to study aging.\n\nCobham is deeply committed to mentorship and community outreach. As a first-generation Black woman from a low-income community, Cobham is deeply aware of the many challenges faced by students from historically underrepresented groups in the life sciences, especially women students.&quot;,
