  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The Dub Gideon Band was founded in 2009 on the west side of San Antonio,Texas by a group of young men who were deeply inspired by Bob Marley and the spirit of RastafarI.  After the release of their first EP in 2011, titled &quot;Underworld EP in Dub&quot;, and the follow up EP &quot;Live in Love&quot; (2012), the band quickly became a staple at all Reggae events around Central Texas and established itself as a force to be recognized,    Always rooted in the dub tradition the band started to become a backing outfit for artists in the area who they felt needed a platform to perform their music.  The band has backed amazing Texas, international, and Jamaican talent alike such as Likkle Shanx, Jahn TI, Chris Boomer, Island Rose, Moe Monsarrat, Dre Z Melodi, Mister Kali, General Smiley (Michigan and Smiley), Admiral Tibet, Warrior king, Tristan Palma, Spiritual, Luciano, and so many more. Currently based in Austin, the band has re-emerged with a collection of some of Austin&#39;s finest Reggae musicians alongside original members from San Antonio.   More than a band, Dub Gideon is a concept, and a force in the world of Reggae Music committed to upholding the true integrity of Roots and Culture Dub Music</p>
