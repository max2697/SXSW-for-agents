  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>A tale as old as time: employers need talent but can’t see who’s job-ready, and job seekers need quality jobs but have limited visibility into what’s available and pathways to get there. We’re changing that in Cleveland by coming together around a shared vision of what works and what will drive better outcomes for everyone—especially those who’ve been systemically excluded. By leveraging AI (without sacrificing any existing jobs!), we’re transforming how we connect people to opportunity and advancing economic opportunity and mobility through a smarter, more equitable workforce infrastructure.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Michelle Rose serves as the Chief Executive Officer of Greater Cleveland Works. In this role, she leads workforce development programming and strategy for employers and jobseekers in Cuyahoga County. Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb appointed Michelle to lead this organization in June 2022, and she has shepherded it through the process to re-launch as a nonprofit while improving delivery of services and embarking on a new strategic direction. In this role, she also established the Built Environment Collaborative, securing $10 million to connect more Clevelanders to good jobs in the skilled trades and remove barriers to success. Prior to this role, she spent most of her career at the United States Department of Labor as a senior advisor on legislative and intergovernmental affairs.&quot;,
