  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The royalty landscape has never been more fragmented — or more ripe for missed income. As short-form video, UGC remixes, micro-sync, and AI-generated content explode, artists and rights holders are fighting to keep payments transparent and fair. This session brings together leaders to unpack where the biggest royalty “black holes” are hiding now, why legacy collection models can’t keep up, and how direct licensing, better data, and new tech are helping close the gap. Expect real-world examples of found money and clear steps artists can take to plug revenue leaks before they happen.</p>
