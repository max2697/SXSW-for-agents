  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>AI is rapidly reshaping how we work, create, and connect—yet at the same time, people are craving the tactile, the real, and the human. As AI-generated content floods our world, a new question emerges: where do we fit?

This panel explores the tension between acceleration and authenticity. How do we design AI that strengthens community instead of replacing it? How do we protect meaning, creativity, and trust in an era of misinformation and automation?

Innovation leaders will examine the cultural shift already underway and share a vision for an AI-powered future where human values and relationships remain at the center.</p>
