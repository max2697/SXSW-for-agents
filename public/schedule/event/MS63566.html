  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Olivia Morreale (aka Princess Liv) possesses a powerhouse vocal and creative sensibility that have defined her presence as a versatile artist across several genres. She has toured the world performing with Grammy- winning rock, pop, and country acts, using her experiences in varied musical contexts to perfect her own sound. As a solo artist born in Manhattan, NY, the songs she writes and the way she sings them are steeped in the jazz tradition that she picked up during her high school days at jazz clubs in Manhattan, but with an indie pop spin. Many of her lyrics reflect her experiences on the road, and she has built a loyal following online through her presence on the scene as a writer and musician. Liv has also toured her own project throughout the US; her latest EP “Return to Sender” is a culmination of her past few years of adventure, heartbreak, and growth.</p>
