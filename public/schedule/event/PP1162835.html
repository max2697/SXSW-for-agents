  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>AI models process vast signals; humans bring judgment and context. But who calls real-world outcomes better, and when? This session compares human and model forecasts on headline events, drawing on newsroom practice, product experience, and reasoning-centric AI research. We’ll map where models’ pattern breadth wins, where human context does, and why hybrids often work best. Instead of scoreboards alone, we’ll discuss how journalists and analysts should use uncertainty ranges, disclose methods and sources, and avoid feedback loops that can steer the story itself.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Eva Vivalt is an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Toronto whose research examines why evidence does - or does not - inform public policy, with particular attention to uncertainty, behavioral biases, and forecasting. This work includes meta-research and research on AI-based forecasting, with a focus on improving decision-making in science and policy. Vivalt is a principal investigator on multiple randomized controlled trials of guaranteed income and a co-founder of the Social Science Prediction Platform, which coordinates and evaluates forecasts of research results. Across this research agenda, Vivalt’s work has been supported by major public and philanthropic funders, including the NIH, NSF, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. After completing a PhD in Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and postdoctoral work at New York University, Vivalt held roles at the World Bank and the Australian National University before joining the University of Toronto.&quot;,
