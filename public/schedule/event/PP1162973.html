  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Today’s creators aren’t just hosting shows – they’re building media empires. In this live conversation, leading voices in podcasting share how they’ve taken their shows to the next level and grown into full-fledged creator brands. They’ll discuss how audience connection, creative control, smart monetization, and business strategy fuel their growth as they scale from indie success to industry icons.


Together, the group will unpack what it now takes to build a show that grows beyond the feed – into community, video, partnerships, products, and more. This is the new era of creator ambition: where podcasts become platforms, creators own their rise, and the next generation of icons are built by those serious about scale.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Cynthia Bailey is a supermodel-turned-reality icon who redefined what it means to be a \&quot;housewife” during her 11-season reign on The Real Housewives of Atlanta. From walking runways in the 1990s to founding the Bailey Agency School of Fashion, she has built a legacy at the intersection of entertainment and entrepreneurship. Known for her “50-11” wisdom and iconic peacemaking (remember \&quot;Cynthia&#39;s Angel\&quot; glasses?), she&#39;s since pivoted to wine ventures, acting (The Traitors), and candidly documenting her post-divorce reinvention. Cynthia embodies the modern multi-hyphenate: model, mogul, and meme queen who keeps it honest about second acts.&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Crystal Kung Minkoff isn&#39;t your typical reality star. As the first Asian American housewife on RHOBH, she broke barriers while dealing with everything from cultural stereotypes to &#39;disengagegate.&#39; But there&#39;s more to her than TV drama - she&#39;s the founder of Real Coco, building a sustainable beverage brand from the ground up while navigating the challenges of being an Asian woman in the wellness space. Off-screen, she&#39;s become an unexpected voice for AAPI representation, using her platform to call out anti-Asian hate and advocate for mental health. Married to Lion King director Rob Minkoff, she lives at the intersection of Hollywood glamour and real-world activism - with the receipts to prove it.&quot;,
