  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Aaron Page is an emerging force in contemporary R&amp;B whose music is as heartfelt as it is captivating. His journey began early, watching his older brother perform in a high school quartet and singing at talent shows during summers spent at his family’s camp. Early on, those cafeteria performances sparked a love for music that deepened with time. Aaron’s artistic foundation was laid at a music and arts academy in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he became the lead vocalist in a jazz ensemble and honed his understanding of song structure. It was there he realized music wasn’t just a passion – it was his purpose. Drawing inspiration from icons like Drake, Kanye West, John Mayer, Ryan Leslie, The Weeknd, and Michael Jackson, Aaron developed a sound that is moody, melodic, and emotionally raw. R&amp;B runs deep in Aaron’s veins – it’s the core of his identity and the soundtrack of his upbringing. His lyrics are rooted in personal experiences and the world around him, unafraid to be vulnerable and honest. That sincerity resonates in tracks like “Pretty Girls Love R&amp;B” – a breakout hit celebrating women and creating a vibe that’s both comforting and confident. Aaron has already left his mark on major stages nationwide, joining R&amp;B heavyweights PARTYNEXTDOOR on the Sorry I’m Outside Tour and Bryson Tiller on the Back and Better Tour as an opening act. Whether on stage or in the studio, Aaron moves with love and intention, using music as both an escape and a celebration. Most recently, Aaron released his new EP, Before I Go – a sultry, rain-soaked sonic experience that offers a glimpse into his evolving style. With smooth melodies and infectious rhythms, the project is perfect for summer nights, late drives, and moments of reflection. It’s a boundary-pushing body of work that positions him as a distinctive voice in modern R&amp;B. Now, he’s stepping boldly into the spotlight – bringing a fresh, emotionally rich perspective to R&amp;B while honoring the genre’s timeless soul.</p>
