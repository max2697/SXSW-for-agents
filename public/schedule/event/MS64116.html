  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Delilah Cabrera, professionally known as Delilah, is a Mexican-American singer-songwriter and Interscope Records artist from Wenatchee, Washington. Raised in a bilingual household, she discovered her passion for music early, singing mariachi at school events and participating in choir—experiences that shaped her emotionally rich, culturally rooted sound.
A multi-instrumentalist who plays piano, guitar, violin, and vihuela, Delilah blends traditional Mexican music with contemporary influences. Her career shifted after a viral performance caught the attention of Los CT Records, founded by Natanael Cano, leading to her signing as the label’s first female artist in its Mexican division through an Interscope partnership.
She has released singles including “Amor Perdido,” “Modelo,” “Entre la Maleza,” and “Butterfly,” collaborated with Becky G on “TODO,” and shared stages with Iván Cornejo. In 2025, she performed at the Selena Tribute Concert in Chicago. Her Interscope debut single, “SI DIOS LO QUERÍA,” was released in September 2025. Now 18, Delilah continues to emerge as a powerful new voice in Latin music.</p>
