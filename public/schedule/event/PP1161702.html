  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As AI takes center stage and political resistance to equity accelerates, Black-centered EdTech stands at a crossroads. This panel spotlights philanthropic, nonprofit, product, and platform leaders working to protect the cultural, pedagogical, and digital infrastructure of Black EdTech. One year into new AI regulations and increasing DEI rollbacks, we’ll explore how to build for resilience – embedding protections into platforms, pedagogy, and policy. What does it take not just to survive, but to lead and thrive in the face of erasure?</p>
