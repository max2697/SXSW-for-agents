  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>I-SKY, West Malaysian based Producer-DJ - inspired by the likes
of Skrillex, Baauer, TNGHT and Boys Noize; started with shows that always promised a
tailored selection expanding from his favourite local/regional products to carefully curated underground dance finds from his internet digs, he since has established himself as a household name in the 2010s KL nightlife scene.

While DJ-ing has always been a conduit for his artistry, I-SKY delivers his crafted studio-to-stage experience best as both an artist and passionate producer. Known for his fresh-to-death remixes, I-SKY originals ride along the same wavelength too through his constant redefinitions of electronic dance.
Though the name doesn&#39;t have any literal meaning, the autodidactic disciplinary defines his namesake with, &quot;I just needed
to find a catchy name... to find something that rhymes with my first initial, hence, the I... and SKY. Over the years, I guess the name gave meaning to itself. There&#39;s a saying: the sky is the limit. I&#39;ve always hated being stuck in a box. I like to let my creativity run wild. To be free to experiment &amp; dabble in different sounds &amp; styles. So, l am the limit to what I can and wanna do.&quot;</p>
