  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Pat G is an American rapper based in Austin, Texas, bringing a refreshing, purpose-driven voice to modern hip-hop. Known for his infectious energy and uplifting message, he creates family-friendly music that still hits hard—blending motivation, faith, and elite lyricism into every performance.

Pat G has performed across California, Florida, Oregon, Texas, Louisiana, and internationally in Toronto, building a growing national and global fanbase. He has been booked three times for the iconic Pecan Street Festival, selected as an official show artist five times, and has performed at major events and venues including Circuit of the Americas, Temple Bloomin’ Festival, and Indie Week Toronto. Closing out 2024, he opened for Lupe Fiasco on four live shows—marking a major career milestone.

Originally from Temple, Texas, Pat G uses music—grounded in his Christian faith—to tell real stories, unite audiences, and inspire hope.
