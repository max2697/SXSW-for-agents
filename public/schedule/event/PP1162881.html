  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Healthcare is at an inflection point: soaring costs, regulatory uncertainty and public mistrust. All signs point to change, but what form will it take? This discussion brings together leaders from across healthcare, life sciences and technology to explore what meaningful disruption in healthcare looks like, and what it will take to rebuild trust, advance equity and deliver innovation at scale. Drawing from experience in emergency care, communications and technology, we&#39;ll imagine what a more connected future of care could look like and how those aspiring to improve it can bring it to life.</p>
