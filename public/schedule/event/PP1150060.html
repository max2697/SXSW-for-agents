  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Every breakout creator starts the same way: with a small but engaged audience. But turning early traction into predictable income is where most creators get stuck. In this fireside chat, two operators who have helped thousands of creators -- and built their own businesses from scratch -- go deep on what actually drives sustainable growth in 2026.

Through a candid, tactical conversation, Tyler Denk and Codie Sanchez will unpack:
1. How early-stage creators identify and keep their highest-value audience.
2. What separates creators who break out from those who stall.
3. The first revenue streams that create real momentum.
4. The systems and workflows that compound growth over time.
5. The most common traps new creators fall into — and how to avoid them.

Attendees will leave with a clear, actionable blueprint for turning a small audience into a meaningful, durable creator business.</p>
