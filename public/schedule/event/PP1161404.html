  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Climate change impacts students not just physically, but emotionally as well. This session introduces the H.O.P.E. Framework (Healing Opportunities for Processing Eco-Grief), a practical, story-based approach for helping teachers and students recognize and respond to climate emotions. Rooted in hope theory and literature, the framework offers tools to spark meaningful conversations and build emotional resilience. Participants will explore current research, hear from educators using the approach, and leave with ready-to-use resources for emotionally responsive climate education.</p>
