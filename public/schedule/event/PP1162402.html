  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>What makes a piece of journalism ripe for adaptation? As headlines spark conversations across social and in everyday life, studios are attuned to how audiences respond—often using that response to guide their next project. But it’s publishers that are uniquely positioned to bring these stories to the screen, thanks to their unparalleled access to journalists and sources.

Hear from Vox Media, Buzzfeed, and The Atlantic as they share insights on which stories to adapt,  how to decide the best genre for journalism IP, and how to work with journalists to expand reporting across platforms.</p>
