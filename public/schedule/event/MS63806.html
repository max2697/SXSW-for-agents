  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Chalk is the project of award-winning musicians and filmmaker
duo Ross Cullen and Benedict Goddard. An informed mix of
Dublin&#39;s guitar band scene and the sweaty hardcore dance
floors of their native Belfast, Chalk are IDLES meets Daniel Avery,
Death Grips meets Bicep - techno-infused industrial punk.
Since forming in 2022, Chalk have had a rise like no other,
quickly establishing themselves as an unmissable live act and
unpredictable, ferocious songwriters. Their debut UK/IRE tour
sold out, and led to further bookings across Europe as word of
their performance and guitar-melded techno spread via word of
mouth and support with national radio in the UK.
These songs were collated into the Conditions Trilogy, a family of
thirteen tracks that combine gritty Irish and German-influenced
techno and dance music with gothic, post-punk and jagged
guitar riffs and vocal melodies. This unique blend earned them
the support and kudos of their peers in Fontaines D.C., IDLES
and Sprints, all of whom handpicked the band to support them
throughout their tours.
