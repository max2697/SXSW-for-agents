  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>A little over a year ago, Dr. Elisabeth Potter scrubbed out of an operating room to take a call from an insurance company and stepped into a national conversation about how our system is treating patients and healthcare workers. Time to scrub out again, and talk about the health of our $5.6 trillion system, the value of independent voices and the state of our healthcare workforce. She is joined on stage by Trina Spear, co-Founder and CEO of Figs, Inc. for a conversation, a pep talk, a call for assistance to creative innovators willing to take on a big, hairy challenge.</p>
