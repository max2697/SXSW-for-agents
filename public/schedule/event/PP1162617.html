  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Featuring the urban visionaries behind NYC&#39;s High Line and DC&#39;s 11th Street Bridge Park, this session will explore how we can transform America&#39;s abandoned spaces – from old rail lines to vacant bridges – into community-built urban oases. Drawing insights from their new book, &quot;Inspiration from the Field,&quot; Scott and Kira will inspire park advocates, urban planners, and city-lovers alike to reimagine America’s post-industrial infrastructure as public assets that can connect rather than divide, while unlocking new economic opportunities and scalable investment into neighboring communities.</p>
