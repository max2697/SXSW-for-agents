  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>When FEET self-released their debut album in 2019, the group offered up a particularly oblique title: What’s Inside Is More Than Just Ham. But once listeners delved into the record,  they found sloshing’s of guitar music that careered wildly between indie, psych, and subtle shades of new wave across an exciting and unpredictable 35 minutes. Since then, FEET have seen prominent live shows have seen them supporting the likes of Inhaler and even The Rolling Stones at their huge 2022 Hyde Park shows. The bands second album &quot;Make It Up&quot; garnered further critical acclaim with the band being invited to perform a BBC 6Music Live session off the back of the single releases Greasy Boy, Why Would I Lie and The Real Thing. 

The band are returning in 2026 with their third album to be released on Submarine Cat Records amidst a year of heavy touring which will see the band on two UK and European headline stints throughout the album campaign. A very welcome return, then, for one of Britain’s most inventive bands, starting a new chapter afresh that builds on the brilliance of their first outing and takes it to a new level entirely. 2026, it’s fair to say, is ready for Feet to stomp all over it.</p>
