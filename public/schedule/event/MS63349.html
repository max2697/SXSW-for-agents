  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>We are a Mexican lead British 3-piece alternative post-grunge rock band. Starting in early 2022, our lead singer moved from Mexico to the UK. The band formed after an impromptu rehearsal session and discovering the chemistry we had playing together we quickly got to work. Writing, playing gigs and recording, releasing our first single in that same year, shortly followed by our debut EP Lonesome Joy. We are now about to release our debut Album with the first few singles already out and their music videos on YouTube hitting almost half a million views. 
Hailing from Mexico, Giselle brought to the UK her unique taste and a talent for writing folk pop, looking to explore a new musical direction fuelled by a passion for rock. Finding Cameron and Charlie, two British born and raised musicians marked the inception of I See Orange, mixing multiple genres into their unique post-grunge sound, a deliberate combo of captivating melodies, clever lyricism and heavy rock.
Bringing raw energy, heavy riffs and powerful melodic vocals to every stage we hit. We blend the gritty, nostalgic sound of the 90&#39;s with our own unique twist.</p>
