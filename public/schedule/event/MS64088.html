  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Willgood has now been DJing long enough that the original plan to fund a nationwide automotive repainting initiative exclusively in red has been officially downgraded from “ambitious” to “symbolic.” What started as a financial experiment became a long-term commitment to dance floors, tasteful grooves, and basslines that behave like they know what they’re doing.

Still operating without formal mentorship (DJ Pagliacci remains legally unreachable), Willgood approaches DJing as a serious craft with unserious presentation favoring disco, house, and dance music that sneaks up on you, locks in, and refuses to rush. Still has the long term goal of being the 4th member of Being Dead. He loves Ferraris, not because they’re fast, but because they’re precise, opinionated, and allergic to subtlety.

The hat is gone. The red remains. Catch Willgood at SXSW doing what he does best: keeping it fun, keeping it moving, and quietly convincing you this was always the plan.</p>
