  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Join Carl Pei for a wide-ranging conversation about where the tech industry is heading in 2026 - and why Nothing is on a mission to make tech for the next generation. In this session, Carl will reflect on how the consumer tech industry became closed and predictable, and why the next era will require a different mindset. He will share his perspective on some of the biggest shifts facing the industry, including the rise of AI-native hardware, and how AI is becoming a core part of the product experience. The conversation will also touch on Nothing’s own next chapter - from its continued push into audio to the brand’s growing physical footprint with new store openings planned across New York City, Tokyo, London, and India this year. Join Carl for a conversation about rebuilding belief in consumer technology, not by constant product launches, but thoughtful design, cultural relevance and products that people genuinely want to live with.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Carl Pei is a founder, product thinker, and challenger of the status quo. In 2020, he launched Nothing – a London-based consumer tech company on a mission to make tech fun again. Backed by GV (Google Ventures), EQT Ventures, and C Ventures, Nothing is one of the only independent tech companies designing and shipping hardware at scale. In just four years, it shipped millions of devices, surpassed $1 billion in lifetime revenue, and built a global community of more than 3 million people. Carl has been featured in Forbes 30 Under 30, Fortune 40 Under 40, and Marketing Week’s Vision 100. But he’s most at home obsessing over the details, building products that break convention and give people something to get excited about again. &quot;,
