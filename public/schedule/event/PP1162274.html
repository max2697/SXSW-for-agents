A former organizer at the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, Tourmaline has built a career rooted in community and trans liberation. Tourmaline’s art is in the permanent collections of The Met, MoMA, Tate, and the Whitney and has been showcased in the Venice Biennale and the Whitney Biennial, and her award-winning films — including the critically acclaimed Happy Birthday, Marsha! — have been recognized for their blend of historical narrative and speculative futurism.

Most recently, her national best-selling book MARSHA (May 2025) received a Starred Review by Publishers Weekly and was featured by The New York Times.&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Richie Shazam is a visionary artist, photographer, and filmmaker who uses her artistic platform to rewrite fashion and beauty standards and to raise awareness on queer issues. Her artistic approach investigates subversive radical queer ideologies by deconstructing antiquated notions of gender identity through photography and video – harmoniously working between fashion and art to dismantle preconceived notions of beauty through the act of storytelling. As a model, Shazam is signed with IMG Models and has walked runways in cities across the world. Her photography has been featured in major publications including Interview and Vogue. Her book \&quot;Shazam\&quot; was released in 2023, with a foreword by Julia Fox.&quot;,
