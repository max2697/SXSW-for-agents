  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As storytelling expands into extended reality media, such as immersive films, VR, MR, AI glasses and location-based installations, spatial audio is emerging as one of the key narrative forces. 

With today’s advanced head-mounted display technology, audiences expect not just 3D visuals but equally rich immersive sound that conveys presence, space and movement.

This panel explores the latest innovation in immersive sound technology and practical application from three different perspectives: software and hardware capabilities of hosting platforms, the spatial audio formats and content production workflows that bring these experiences to life.</p>
