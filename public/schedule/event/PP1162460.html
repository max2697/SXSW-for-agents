  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Even after the first U.S. federal streaming fraud lawsuit in 2024, fraud and anomalous behavior remain major challenges. This panel explores recent developments, how AI is shaping both the problem and the solution, and who’s most impacted. We’ll share personal anecdotes, current case studies, and a ground-level view of how streaming fraud has evolved. We’ll also discuss what’s being done now (besides yelling into the void or shaking our fists at bots)</p>
