  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>If you’ve ever hit “send” and immediately regretted it, you’re not alone. Communication isn’t just what we say—it’s how, when, and why we say it. That said, the music business often feels like guessing the vibe in a room you’ve never walked into. From making meaningful connections to recognizing when you’re overthinking, this panel will help you unpack how to implement the intangibles (personality, first impressions, etiquette, etc.) with purpose and clarity in the music industry. We’ll also explore the fine line between being overbearing and simply asking for help. No matter where you&#39;re at, this is about learning to show up with confidence and authenticity every time.</p>
