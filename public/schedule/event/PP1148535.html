      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Jackie Moy is an experiential designer who studied architecture to explore how space can shape storytelling. Her work spans haunted houses, immersive theater sets, retail windows, selfie palaces, art installations, and parade floats. She has also contributed to arts organizations, from a nonprofit dedicated to global textile traditions to a foundation supporting Japanese American artists. Today she brings the same sense of immersion and narrative into digital environments, playfully experimenting with techniques like deep fakes and forgeries, always with benign intent.&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Tara is an artist and multidisciplinary graphic designer, with 15 years of experience crafting interactive multimedia experiences for businesses large and small, like Square, Mixpanel, and Tile. She embraces all types of materials and techniques in her visual art, transforming junk mail, packaging, and other trash into mixed media creations that she sends through the mail via the International Union of Mail Artists.\r\rShe is inspired by how belief impacts the reality we experience and seeks to shape new realities by experimenting with distortions in perception and weaving narratives that engage with the limits of human understanding. At the core of her work is a desire to remind people of their personal power to elicit change in the world.&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Dr. Marc Chun creates immersive learning experiences at the intersection of the power of storytelling, the rigor of research, and the promise of equity. He’s built playwriting labs that surface hidden narratives, escape rooms that spark empathy, and hackathons that activate communities.\r\rA Stanford-trained sociologist, Marc draws on his work at the Stanford d.school to design spaces that invite reflection and action. Having moved from teaching to research to philanthropy, his design work has expanded in scale—from lessons for students, to strategies that change systems, to experiences that help communities learn. His journey reflects a steady pursuit of one question: how people learn, connect, and change—and how design can make those moments more equitable, delightful, and transformative.&quot;,
