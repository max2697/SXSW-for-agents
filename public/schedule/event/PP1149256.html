Guggenheim Museum, New York, The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, The Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, and the Mori Art Museum, Tokyo.

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Tom Sachs (b. 1966, New York City) is an internationally acclaimed sculptor and interdisciplinary artist known for transforming everyday materials into meticulously crafted objects and immersive experiences. Raised in Westport, Connecticut, Sachs studied at Bennington College and London’s Architectural Association before working in Frank Gehry’s Los Angeles furniture shop, shaping his obsession with process, craftsmanship, and the discipline of “Knolling.” In 1991, he founded his studio in Manhattan, creating early exhibitions like Cultural Prosthetics (1995) and Creativity Is the Enemy (1998) that combine luxury branding, pop culture, and everyday objects. His large-scale installations include Nutsy’s (2001–03), a dynamic remote-control car race around icons of modernist art and architecture fashioned from foam core, and Space Program (2007–2025), a series of missions throughout the solar system, each comprised of dozens of multimedia works with materials ranging from plywood to steel to porcelain and beyond. In 2025, Sachs published the Tom Sachs Guide (Phaidon), the most comprehensive explanation of his work, featuring 23 new essays, and launched the I.S.R.U app, a global initiative through NikeCraft challenging individuals to break their bad digital habits by connecting with a series of impactful daily rituals for the mind and body. For four decades, Sachs’s work has been featured in exhibitions around the world and is in the collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum; the Whitney Museum of American Art; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Centre Pompidou, Paris; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Astrup Fearnley Museet, Oslo; National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC; Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven; and The Art Institute of Chicago.&quot;,
