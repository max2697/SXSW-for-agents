  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>AI tools are improving quickly, and educators are already finding meaningful uses for them. What hasn’t been defined yet is the school model that makes AI work for students and teachers in a coherent, reliable way at scale.

This session examines what early adopters of AI in public education are learning in real classrooms and school systems, the concrete design choices and conditions behind early success, and the operational, instructional, and governance questions that must be resolved over the next five years for AI to strengthen public education rather than fragment it.</p>
