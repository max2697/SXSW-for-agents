  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The Inland Empire can either suffocate you or make you work even harder. For the past 10 years, Manuel Joseph Walker’s prolific output as Foliage has helped him become a widely recognized figurehead in modern Shoegaze. A chameleonic producer, Walker draws from the broader palettes of Post-Punk while slyly incorporating textures and ideas from Hip-Hop and Electronic records, revealing ephemeral but lasting impressions that feel simultaneously intimate and ritualistic, something you can listen to in your headphones late at night or shout along with a cold lager in your hand. His song “It’s Time” has been featured in nearly 19K TikToks from brands such as Le Creuset, F1, &amp; Netflix.

With his latest single “Missing Hearts”, featuring a music video he directed, Walker has produced his most arena-ready tune yet. With millions of streams and a reputation for unforgettable live performances, Foliage has evolved from best-kept secret to cornerstone of Indie&#39;s next generation of hitmakers. In the wake of their first full-length record in six years on the way, Foliage is poised to make a massive splash at this year’s SXSW and all through 2026.</p>
