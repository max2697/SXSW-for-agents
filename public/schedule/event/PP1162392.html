  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Work culture gaps remain unbridgeable at many companies, yet failing to shrink them in today&#39;s multi-generational work world is like ignoring the oil light on your dashboard. You&#39;re not avoiding a breakdown—you&#39;re scheduling it for later. Join this remarkable line-up of today&#39;s top work culture experts to hear what keeps driving the divides—and how these designers are helping firms shift traditional career models, link people strategy to business value and use AI and new narratives to improve how people experience work, not as a demographic challenge, but as a design and strategy imperative.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Solange Charas, Ph.D. is a public company board director, governance expert, and Professor of Professional Practice at Columbia University who likes to say that culture isn’t a vibe—it’s an operating system. Her work focuses on how HR performance, leadership systems, and everyday people decisions quietly (and sometimes expensively) determine whether strategy actually turns into results.\n\nOver a 35+ year career as a senior executive, advisor, and board leader, Solange has worked inside boardrooms, executive teams, and M&amp;amp;A deals when growth stalled, change got messy, and performance gaps couldn’t be explained by strategy alone. As Founder and CEO of HCMoneyball, she has advised hundreds of organizations and supported more than 80 transactions, helping leaders connect the dots between role clarity, access, trust, engagement—and hard business outcomes like speed, productivity, retention, and ROI.\n\nKnown for her candid and engaging speaking style, Solange translates complex ideas about HR, culture, and AI into practical insights leaders can actually use. She’s currently writing a new book on Managing Human Capital in Professional Services Firms, exploring how analytics, AI, and accountability are reshaping value creation in knowledge-driven organizations.\n\nShe is co-author of Humanizing Human Capital: Invest in Your People for Optimal Business Returns, a Distinguished Principal Research Fellow at The Conference Board, and a member of the ISO Human Capital Committee shaping global standards for workforce measurement and disclosure. When she’s not thinking about enterprise value, she’s a devoted dog mom—convinced that some of the best leadership lessons happen on long walks.&quot;,
