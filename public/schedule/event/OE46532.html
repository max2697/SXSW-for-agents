  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The SXSW Community Service Awards celebrate leaders and non-profit organizations from Austin and around the world who work tirelessly to improve the standing of the specific groups and causes that they serve.Mary Bailey is a dedicated community organizer and social justice advocate. As managing director &amp; co-founder of the criminal justice reform non-profit, Last Prisoner Project, Mary leads development efforts and cultivates community partnerships that enable Last Prisoner Project to fight for the release of cannabis prisoners and support them as they rebuild their lives. Her dedication to this mission has bolstered the organization&#39;s programs, which has saved over 360 years of prison time, provided $9M in legal services, passed 10 record clearance laws, and distributed over $3.8M to constituents through direct grants, commissary funds, and other financial support. She feels strongly that nobody should be in prison for cannabis and is dedicated to helping to inspire a more socially conscious cannabis industry.Before co-founding Last Prisoner Project, she was the CEO of Alpha Agency, a Hawaii-based production company specializing in creating events that inspire positive social change through music, education, and community engagement. She also hosted the Maui Cannabis Conference, the Maui Yoga Festival, and monthly community block parties for the County of Maui Office of Economic Development. Mary received the High Times Dope Award and the High Times list of the Top 100 Most Influential People in the Cannabis Industry, the Advocate of the Year Award from Benzinga, the Top 100 Most Influential People for Activism by Cannabis Global Times, 40 under 40 from Cannabis Now Magazine, and serves as a SXSW Mentor.</p>
