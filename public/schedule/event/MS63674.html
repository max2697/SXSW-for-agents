  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Fine is a Copenhagen-based singer-songwriter and producer whose music blends samples, acoustic and electric instruments into a groovy and ethereal crossover sound, both familiar and dreamlike.

Her debut album, Rocky Top Ballads (2024), turns experiments into songs by cutting and layering band improvisations. Bringing them together with melodies and voice. The album features loose-wristed-head-bobbing drums, a wide range of guitar sounds, bass riffs, reverb-soaked atmospheres, and real sound recordings — all woven together with Fine&#39;s distinctive voice and lyrics.

Live, Fine reshapes her hypnotic sound together with her band: Lola Hammerich on guitar (Baby in Vain), Andreas Murga on bass (Gorgeous), and Mads Muurholm on drums.

Starting early, Fine began her career over a decade ago with the Danish electronic trio Chinah, releasing three albums. She has since co-written for New Jeans with Erika de Casier and Smerz, attended Clarissa Connelly’s Kanonschoir, and collaborated with Astrid Sonne under the moniker Coined.</p>
