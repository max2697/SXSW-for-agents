  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Young people are in the midst of a sex recession – they’re having much less sex, way less often – and they’re taking flak from all sides. Some say young women are too sex negative in the wake of #MeToo and the fall of Roe v Wade. Others blame young men for becoming enamored with the manosphere and internet porn. 

Placed against the backdrop of a sexually-conservative, anti-LGBTQ+ Trump administration – and a Democratic opposition too scared to broach the subject – this conversation will explore Gen Z’s worries about romance and dating, and what it means for the rest of us.</p>
