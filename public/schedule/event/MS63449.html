  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Nilipek. is a Berlin-based Turkish singer-songwriter whose delicate yet powerful sound has shaped the landscape of Turkish alternative music for the last decade. Her performances blend delicate, breathy vocals with moments of raw intensity; creating an atmosphere that shifts between vulnerability and bursts of noise. 

Releasing her long-awaited fourth album, Uydurduğumuz Oyunlarla (“The Games We Made Up”) digitally in May 2024 and on vinyl in January 2025, she delivered her most intricate and emotionally resonant work yet. The tracks promise the listener a forty-five-minute uninterrupted journey while combining political symbolism in lyrics with innovative musical arrangements. The album also elegantly portrays Nilipek.’s musical evolution since her first album in 2015.

This year, the Turkish singer-songwriter is releasing her first fully English single, Safe Coast, in collaboration with the producer Cody Fitzgerald (Stolen Jars). The song captures the search for meaning and security in an ever-shifting, and increasingly perilous world, while creating a sanctuary in its sound.</p>
