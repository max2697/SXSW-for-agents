  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Blending together the sounds of indie pop and folk melodies, Bea Porges lives in her own lyrical world. Throughout the years, the 25 year old singer songwriter has been working her way through the scenes of Atlanta and Athens, GA, and billing with touring acts such as hey, nothing, Infinity Songs, and Trash Panda. Her songwriting has a penchant for detail and wit, creating images that feel simultaneously personal and nostalgic.

While her love for solo songwriting is at the core of her musical endeavors, Bea performs as a five piece, turning acoustic songs into powerful and danceable live show that compliments her truthful lyrics. 

Filled with electric guitar and sprinkled with the sounds of banjo and lap steel, Bea’s 2025 EP, “The Cure, The Cause, The Killer,” explores feelings of desire, longing, and letting go with nods to the artists and genres that inspire her most. Through her love for songwriting and creating a symphony of sound from scratch, Bea channels her inner lyrical world into lived experience that is fuller and brighter.</p>
