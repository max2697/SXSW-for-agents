  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Formed in the lockdown winter of 2021, Agatha Is Dead! began as a post-punk experiment between longtime friends Lilly and Noah, who first made music together in their school days. Their shared love for Joy Division, The Cure, Molchat Doma, and Fontaines D.C. laid the foundation for their darkly urgent sound. With the addition of drummer Joey Ramone Hansen−bringing grunge and pop−punk bite−and Arthur on bass, the band played their first shows in 2022 and quickly carved out a place in Berlin&#39;s underground scene.

The band signed to Berlin label Duchess Box Records in May 2025 and will release their debut EP &quot;order&quot; in on 10th October.

The first singles drew attention from big online magazines such as Post-Punk.com and Diffus as well as major radio station airplay and big playlist support from Spotify and Apple Music.

This September, the band will embark on their first-ever headline tour with shows in Berlin and Leipzig selling out in advance., marking a new chapter in their journey. Their Berlin show at Privatclub sold out an incredible five months in advance, underscoring the growing excitement surrounding the band.

Drawing further inspiration from The Pretty Reckless, DIIV, Liily, and Bloc Party, Agatha Is Dead! have honed a sound that is heavy, hypnotic, and deeply emotional. With their debut EP Order on the horizon, the band are staking their claim in the next wave of alternative rock−grabbing hearts, shaking stages, and refusing to go unnoticed.</p>
