  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Kids is an art punk project focused on writing the most subversive music possible within tight limitations. Their sound is characterized by a lack of effects pedals, idiosyncratic arrangements and song forms, and an irreverent high energy that contrasts with their relatively minimal sound. The crown jewel of Kids is in the double vocals: All of their music relies on meticulous interplay between Venezuelan guitarist Julio Prato and bass player Ani Kramer on the vocal front, reimagining the idea of a song as more of a conversation between lead vocalists rather than the highlight of just one. All this is laid atop a flurry of cutting edge guitar work, grounding bass lines, and the one-of-a-kind surgical manner of drumming Colin Ferguson always brings to the table. 

Their debut full length album REPETITIOM VARIATIOM released in the summer of 2024 is their most ambitious release to date, relying on disorientation,  indulgently varying repetition, evocative imagery, and their signature sound palette to conceive music that feels familiar, humorous and encouraging, yet pronouncedly uncanny.</p>
