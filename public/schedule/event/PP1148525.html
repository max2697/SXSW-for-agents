  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>How can we prepare a generation to understand the renewed global nuclear threats when so many students know little about nuclear history or policymaking? This session features two nuclear policy experts–supporters of education on these issues–and spotlights public media’s role in creating compelling video, primary sources, and inquiry-based learning to bring nuclear history and global security policy into the classroom. We’ll explore how media-based tools can help teachers address topics like deterrence, disarmament, and democratic accountability in a complex world.</p>
