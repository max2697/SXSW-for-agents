  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Chris Perez and his partners Michael Donaldson and Dale Nelson will be back for another lively
(and surprisingly entertaining) update on the many legal developments affecting the indie film
community.

The distribution landscape has once again changed since last we were together at SXSW.  While the number of buyers for independent films seems to have contracted, numbers show that the theatrical business is alive and well, and films are still getting financed and produced. The Trump administration has cut funding for public television, affecting the documentary film market. New distribution models have sprung up, and self-distribution is once again a popular route.

Since last year, several legal issues have come to the fore. The topic that continues to take
shape from a legal standpoint is AI. What do you need to be concerned about as a user of
GenAI content? As a creator, should you be concerned about use of your works to train LLMs?
We will explore the ever-evolving legal landscape when it comes to AI.

Fair use continues to be a useful tool for both documentary and scripted filmmakers, so we’ll
cover the latest fair use cases affecting filmmakers.

Films based on or inspired by a true story continue to not only be popular among viewers but
have also led to a number of important lawsuits.

Bring all your burning questions, because these three leaders in the indie industry tend to stay
on to help you learn more about anything you need to know.</p>
