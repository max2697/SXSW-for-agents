      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Being in love with music his whole life, Max dreamed of working in the music industry since he was a child. After studying Political Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, Max decided to make that dream a reality and continued his education getting a B.S. in Music Business from the University of Colorado Denver. While in school, Max dipped his feet in as many aspects of the industry as possible by interning and working for multiple companies including The Orchard, Superfly, and 7S Management. It was through these experiences that he found his true passion of discovering emerging talents and working directly with songwriters and producers in developing their craft and growing their professional careers.\n\nIn 2019, Max made the move from Denver to Los Angeles and joined Angry Mob Music as A&amp;amp;R Coordinator. Max is now A&amp;amp;R Manager with day to day tasks including setting up co-writing sessions, pitching music to artists and their representatives, and developing the AMM roster as a whole. He is also the proud co-founder of The New Normal Writing Camp which was created to bring our songwriting community together and lift each other up in an industry where underrepresented voices are often held back due to the old ways of thinking. The New Normal encourages diversity and champions the melting pot of cultural backgrounds, which brings a unique and universally relatable perspective into the music world.&quot;,

    &quot;company_bio&quot;: &quot;Discovr is an artist-focused service that lets musicians and songwriters have their music played on radio station streams, alongside broadcast programming. Artists, labels, managers, and distributors can use Discovr to upload tracks and have them inserted into radio streams – in place of ad interruptions – through faidr, a radio streaming app. Once a track has been approved, Discovr customers can monitor listener engagement and behavior through a robust analytics dashboard.\n\n\n\n&quot;,
