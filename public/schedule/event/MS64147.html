  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Here is a polished, professional version suitable for a press page:

---

**DJ EXILE** has played a pivotal role in elevating Latin music within the nightlife scene of Las Vegas. As an official DJ on Jennifer Lopez’s *“It’s My Party”* tour, he brought his high-energy sound to arenas across the country, solidifying his presence on a national stage.

He has also opened for and performed alongside some of the biggest names in reggaeton and Latin music, including Bad Bunny, J Balvin, and Ozuna, at premier nightlife destinations such as Drai&#39;s Nightclub, Omnia Nightclub, Marquee Nightclub, and KAOS.

Touring extensively throughout the United States, DJ EXILE continues to expand his reach while staying deeply connected to his hometown audience.

A proud Las Vegas native with a strong and loyal following in the Vegas Valley, he is also the Co-Founder of Altura Presents, one of the premier Latin entertainment brands in Las Vegas. Through large-scale festivals, nightclub takeovers, weekly events, and concerts, Altura Presents continues to shape and elevate the city’s Latin music culture.
