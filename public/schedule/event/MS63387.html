  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>DJ AG is a genre-shifting DJ and producer whose influence sits at the crossroads of Black British culture, global pop and contemporary electronic music. His sets move from grime and UK rap to afrobeats and alternative soul without losing pace or purpose. This approach has made him a trusted name for artists and audiences who want more than a standard club experience.

AG has shared stages with and played for artists including Ed Sheeran, Will Smith, Burna Boy and Skepta. His profile continues to grow as he brings his sound to live shows, brand events and cultural moments that pull in diverse crowds. Known for reading a room with accuracy rather than hype, AG builds environments where every transition feels intentional.

His work has been covered by a range of platforms and press titles reflecting his reach across culture, style and music. Coverage includes features and appearances in GRM Daily, Complex, Notion, Trench, Mixtape Madness and BBC platforms which have positioned him as one of the most versatile names emerging from the UK scene.</p>
