  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Think that Gen Alpha are just mini Gen Zs in waiting? Think again. Drawing on new global research among more than 80,000 Gen Alphas, this session will unpack the digital behaviors, subcultures, and emotional drivers set to shape the next era of brand connection. What does loyalty mean to a generation raised on creator culture, co-creation and digital experimentation? How are concepts such as trust and value evolving?  We’ll explore how cultural nuance, parenting, and technology shape their worldview, and how brands can build trust through ethical, insight-led engagement.</p>
