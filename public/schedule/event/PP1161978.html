  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Engaging art is a creative act. There are art galleries and museums everywhere. Let&#39;s use them well. Art objects aren&#39;t puzzles to solve, but rather invitations to experience something new and make it personally meaningful. As Josiah McElheny explains, “The experience of art is a kind of fusion of your experience of yourself and of the object.” In doing this personal creativity is exercised and you get smarter. This session will get you started on doing it well, showing how to exercise effectively.</p>
