      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Jeremy \&quot;Falcon\&quot; Stephan is a technology operator, executive advisor, and founder of The Mind Shift Network, where he works at the intersection of leadership, innovation, and human performance. With more than 15 years of experience in the tech ecosystem, Falcon has partnered with startup founders, executives, and boards to help companies scale through periods of rapid growth and change, spanning go-to-market strategy, organizational alignment, and culture.\n\nEarlier in his career, Falcon helped build multiple high-growth technology companies from early traction to acquisition, including serving as VP of Sales at ArcTouch, which scaled from under $1M in revenue to over $20M before being acquired by WPP. He is known for a deeply consultative approach and a belief that sustainable growth comes from aligning people, systems, and purpose.\n\nOutside of technology, Falcon is a dedicated freediver, capable of holding his breath for over five minutes and diving to depths of 55 meters in the open ocean. The discipline of freediving—calm under pressure, presence, and self-awareness—has strongly influenced how he approaches leadership and decision-making.\n\nThrough The Mind Shift Network, Falcon works with executives, creatives, and entrepreneurs exploring intentional practices, including psychedelic facilitation &amp;amp; integration, to expand perspective, enhance creativity, and cultivate emotionally intelligent leadership. His work bridges emerging science with real-world executive experience, helping leaders navigate complexity with clarity and become more heart centered in the work environment.&quot;,
