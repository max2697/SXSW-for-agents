  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The Bantu &amp; Boundless artist, Zola Marcelle, is a Zimbabwean-born, London-based multidisciplinary artist. With a rare mix of Shona and Sotho heritage, her journey through music, culture, and history is steadily shaping her into an exciting contemporary voice of her generation. Raised partially in Bulawayo with a family steeped in music, Zola grew up with a deep connection to song and her African roots. 

Belonging to a generation of active participants in Zimbabwe’s independence struggle, Zola adopted a profound sense of responsibility, identity, and freedom. Having grown up in a home where music was a staple diet, Zola was surrounded by the global sounds of legends like Sankomota, Andrae Crouch, Stevie Wonder, Jimmy Dludlu and Sibongile Khumalo. When she wasn’t listening to these musical greats, Zola would accompany her father on photography outings, a combination of visual and sonic inspiration that would later fuel her own creative process. These early experiences gave her a foundation in both artistry and activism.</p>
