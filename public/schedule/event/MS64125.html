  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The Red Eye Gamblers are a psychedelic southern rock band with a uniquely Austin, Texas sound. They bridge elements of rock, bluegrass, and jammy psychedelia to create a new experience with every show.

They have a deep repertoire, and in over two years of live shows, they have never played the same set list twice. They will often venture outside of their normal 5-piece lineup featuring a saxophone, djembe, and harmonica to create an unforgettable live experience.

They released their debut single &quot;Let You Down Easy&quot; in October 2024. A fan favorite from live shows, &quot;Let You Down Easy&quot; is a fast-paced song about simply saying goodbye. In September 2025, they followed it up with their next single &quot;Whiskey Memories.&quot; &quot;Whiskey Memories&quot; is a powerful ballad about reminiscing on the past and learning to move on from the troubles it may have caused. The song features introspective lyrics, instrumental breakdowns, and showcases even more of what The Red Eye Gamblers have to offer.

From starting with backyard shows in east Austin, all the way to the Continental Club and the incredible stages at SXSW 2025,  The Red Eye Gamblers are one of THE bands to watch for SXSW 2026 &amp; beyond</p>
