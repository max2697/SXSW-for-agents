  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Formed in 1999 in Stillwater, Oklahoma, The All-American Rejects quickly became one of the most iconic rock bands of the 2000s. Led by Tyson Ritter and Nick Wheeler, the band debuted in 2002, featuring their hit &quot;Swing, Swing.&quot; Their 2005 album Move Along cemented their place in rock with chart-toppers like &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot; and &quot;It Ends Tonight.&quot; In 2008, &quot;Gives You Hell&quot; became a global hit and a Billboard No. 1 in 2009. The band continued pushing creative boundaries on Kids in the Street in 2012. Throughout the years, The Rejects have continued evolving, taking their sound in new directions while staying true to the emotional core that’s always defined their music. Their latest singles, “Eggshell Tapdancer” and “Easy Come, Easy Go”, from their upcoming 5th album have proven their undying commitment to writing songs that resonate with fans and prove that their relevance and connection with fans are only getting stronger with time.</p>
