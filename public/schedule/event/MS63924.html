  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The amalgamation of four distinct voices from Adelaide, The Tullamarines tell their stories through a shared perspective that feels intimate, honest, and quietly uplifting. Josh, Angus, Benny and Lucinda met on the local gig circuit, quickly bonding over a mutual love of songwriting and collaboration. From those early connections, they’ve crafted a sound that reflects each member’s individual sensibilities - a style they affectionately call cosy-pop.
 
Their songs move through life’s highs and lows with the warmth of an old friend, inviting listeners into their living room, putting the kettle on, and sitting with whatever feeling the day brings. That sense of closeness runs through both their recorded work and their live shows.
 
Having appeared on festival line-ups including Beyond The Valley, Laneway Festival, Spin Off Festival and New Year’s Eve on the Hill, and toured extensively alongside artists such as Old Mervs, The Preatures, Ball Park Music and Alex Lahey, The Tullamarines continue to build a reputation for heartfelt songwriting and deeply human performances.</p>
