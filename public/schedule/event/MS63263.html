  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>With a Spellemann (norwegian Grammy) nomination for their debut album in hand, Sūn Byrd is ready to kick off  the new campaign for the upcoming album In Paradiso, heavily inspired by American and British soul from the 60s and 70s.

With a horn section that never rests, basslines that drive the songs forward, neatly ironed pants, and undeniable coolness, Sūn Byrd could just as easily be born in New Orleans as in Oslo. But it&#39;s in Norway that they&#39;ve first made a name for themselves. They released their Spellemann-nominated debut album in 2024 and have already played over 250 concerts together. You can just try to imagine how tight Sūn Byrd sounds live, and then add a little more. Now, they&#39;re about to release In Paradiso, their first album on Jansen Records.

On In Paradiso, you&#39;ll be served soulful tracks that follow in the footsteps of artists like Leon Bridges, Thee Sacred Souls, and Sharon Jones and The Dap-Kings. Johan Helland&#39;s vocals are perhaps the first thing that stands out, with its distinctive tone, range, and vulnerability, but it’s when the whole band comes in that you’re truly dazzled. The keys, horns, guitar, and bass all find their place, seamlessly shifting between being a musical locomotive and charming you into submission with beautiful ballads.

Sūn Byrd’s music is universal and timeless, and there’s really nothing that sounds like this on the Norwegian music scene today. It’s perfect for large festival stages, would make a great soundtrack for countless films, or simply while you hang out after closing time at a smoke-filled off-license bar in the southern U.S.
