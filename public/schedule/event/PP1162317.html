  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>AI is reshaping how we build software products—from conversational UX to fast-evolving AI models that can upend product roadmaps and even entire products. In this session, a leading product exec and a Wharton AI expert share how to design products powered by large language models. You&#39;ll learn how AI is reshaping product roles, what it takes to build with ever-evolving models, and why great UX now means thinking in conversations, not clicks.</p>
