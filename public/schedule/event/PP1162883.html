  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Given the need for effective obesity treatments and the limits of current GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as muscle loss, poor tolerability, and frequent dosing, a next-generation solution is essential. Ideal treatments would focus on fat loss and muscle preservation, offer strong safety and tolerability, and be dosed less frequently. Advancements in RNA medicines, growth of human genetics databases, and potential for combination therapies have opened the door for innovative new therapies and combination approaches. Explore expert insights on future treatment opportunities.</p>
