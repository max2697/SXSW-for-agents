  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Let&#39;s be honest: many managers would rather eat glass than tell you why you really didn&#39;t get the promotion, assignment, raise, or bonus. But their avoidance is creating a bigger problem - when leaders dodge difficult conversations, they create a vacuum where perceptions of unfairness flourish. Workplace expert Amy Gallo reveals how the inability (or unwillingness) to have hard conversations is eroding trust in organizations. You&#39;ll learn what transparency really looks like, how to demand the feedback you deserve, and why meritocracy is impossible without managers who can handle the heat.</p>
