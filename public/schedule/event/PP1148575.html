  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Today’s youngest workers are all in on AI — and ghosting their coworkers. There is a new generational shift in workplace dynamics, where Gen Z and emerging Gen Alphas are forming trust bonds with AI tools faster than with humans. They praise AI’s speed, clarity, and lack of pushback, all while struggling with manager feedback, peer collaboration, and team engagement. This panel explores the psychological and social drivers behind these trends and what they mean for designing inclusive, high-trust workplaces powered by both humans and intelligent systems.</p>
