  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Across the industry there are several misconceptions about virtual production. It’s a VFX tool. It’s only good for car scenes or sci-fi. It’s too expensive for independent films. It’s a silver bullet that can fix all problems. 
In this session our panel will bust these myths and provide insight into how filmmakers can truly benefit from virtual production and how it’s changing the film and TV production landscape. And to put it to the test, the session will end with our panel breaking down a film treatment live to show how filmmakers can plan a shoot to get the most out of virtual production.</p>
