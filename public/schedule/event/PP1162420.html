      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Andrew Benin is the Co-Founder and CEO of Graza, the cult-favorite olive oil brand behind the OG squeeze bottles. After two years living in Spain, Benin was enamored with Spanish culture and developed a nurturing relationship with food, determining that olive oil was the glue to every meal and noticing a gap in the industry. Thus, Graza was founded in 2021. Since launch, Benin has rapidly scaled the business to a $240M valuation, with nationwide distribution to 13k retail doors (Whole Foods, Kroger, Target &amp; others). From supply chain management to consulting and design, Benin has worn many hats in his career and continues to do so with his company. Prior to Graza, Benin gained valuable experience in different roles at reputable companies like Magic Spoon, Casper, Warby Parker, and more.&quot;,

His unconventional approach to branding and direct-to-consumer sales cultivated a fervent, cult-like following, proving that authenticity and quality can outmaneuver industry giants without playing by traditional rules.&quot;,
