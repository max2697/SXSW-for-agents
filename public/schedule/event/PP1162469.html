  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Coral reef ecosystems are in crisis due to climate change, pollution, and overfishing, and traditional restoration methods are limited in scale. This panel explores how biotechnology, materials science, and synthetic biology are converging to give reefs a fighting chance. From lab-grown super algae to bioactive reef coatings, scientists and startups are creating new tools to restore reefs faster, smarter, and more effectively. To scale impact, they are also developing sustainable business models and innovative funding partnerships.</p>
