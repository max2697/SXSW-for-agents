  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Bleary Eyed was formed in 2015 by frontman Nathaniel Salfi (guitar &amp; vocals) Since their inception in the DIY scenes of DC and Philadelphia respectively, the band has taken many artistic turns. Through that experimentation, they’ve had time to grow into the sound they were always meant to make, filling a unique space in the shoegaze genre with their sample-heavy hazey computer pop atmosphere. The band presents a positive energy with relatable lyrics with stacked harmonies from Reynolds and Salfi over densely layered sample filled instrumentals. The songs teeter from more pleasant pop songs to heavier fuzz tracks sometimes blending elements from both styles.

The band has released their 3rd LP entitled “Easy” on Born Losers Records. This is some of the band&#39;s best work yet, with more cohesive production and songwriting. Each song is a journey of its own exploring themes of vulnerability and self acceptance via the twists and turns of one&#39;s life.</p>
