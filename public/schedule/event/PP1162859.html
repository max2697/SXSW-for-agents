  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Born in the age of the internet and now Generative AI, Gen Z and Gen Alpha are the most digitally savvy segments we’ve ever seen. But they also have differing expectations for authenticity, connection, and IRL experiences. How well brands meet their unique needs could make or break their ability to foster long-term loyalty. Marketing executives will discuss the nuances, as well as the tactics already in place to reach Gen Z and prepare for Gen Alpha. Both generations continue to raise the bar, and the pressure is on brands to deliver IRL connections now and in the years to come.</p>
