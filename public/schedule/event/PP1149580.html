      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Sal Ojeda’s journey in sound began with rhythm. Raised in Guadalajara, Mexico by way of California, he grew up navigating two cultures and later, two sonic worlds. At 11, a pair of drumsticks changed everything. He quickly fell in love with music and began studying privately with some of the city’s best drummers. Not long after, he joined his father’s band, where he not only performed but also got his first lessons in recording. Those early experiences taught him that sound could do more than capture a performance, it could tell a story.\r\rBy the time he finished high school, Sal had become a fixture in the Guadalajara music scene as a drummer. His fascination with recording and mixing had grown into an obsession, one that pushed him to return to the United States to pursue a career in sound. After a couple of years at Glendale Community College in Arizona, he earned a scholarship to Berklee College of Music, an opportunity that would redefine his path.\r\rAt Berklee, Sal immersed himself in the world of audio recording and production, honing his technical skills and deepening his passion for the art of sound. It was there that he discovered post-production, a field that revealed how sound could shape narratives, heighten emotion, and transform the cinematic experience. Graduating with honors, he left Berklee determined to make his mark in the industry.\r\rIn 2010, Sal relocated to Los Angeles, where he built a career that has combined artistry and technical mastery. His recent work includes Bono: Stories of Surrender (dir. Andrew Dominik), Man on the Run (dir. Morgan Neville), Pavarotti (dir. Ron Howard), The Makings of Curtis Mayfield (dir. H.E.R.), Dear Mama: The Saga of Afeni and Tupac Shakur (dir. Allen Hughes), and RuPaul’s Drag Race. His feature film credits include George Miller’s Three Thousand Years of Longing, Zack Snyder’s Snow Steam Iron, Warner Bros.’ restoration of the iconic Purple Rain, and acclaimed independent films such as Mistura (dir. Ricardo de Montreuil), Trees of Peace, and Hypochondriac.\r\rBeyond mixing, Sal is also an accomplished Dialogue Editor, contributing to TV series such as The Cleaning Lady, Kung Fu, Gotham Knights, and Rescue: Hi Surf. His television and streaming credits span Apple TV+, Hulu, Disney+, HBO, FX, and Netflix, covering everything from high-end documentaries to scripted drama.\r\rHis music background continues to shape his storytelling instincts. Sal has collaborated with an extraordinary roster of artists, including Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, Pink, Bono, Imagine Dragons, Andrea Bocelli, Taylor Swift, Cher, Sting, Lenny Kravitz, Erykah Badu, Gladys Knight, Robert Glasper, and Aloe Blacc. These collaborations have sharpened his ear for nuance and dynamics, qualities that translate seamlessly into his film and television work.\r\rSal’s versatility extends to live productions as well. He has been part of the sound teams behind some of the industry’s most celebrated broadcasts, including The Oscars, The Emmys, The Academy of Country Music Awards, The Kids’ Choice Awards, and the Disney Parks Magical Christmas Day Parade.\r\rWith over 15 years of experience, Sal Ojeda’s work has been recognized with three Emmy nominations, a Golden Reel Award from the Motion Picture Sound Editors, and a Canadian Screen Award. But beyond recognition, what drives him is the pursuit of stories that leave room for sound to become a character in its own right. He thrives when collaborating with directors and producers who see sound not just as a necessity, but as a vital storytelling tool.\r\rWhether shaping the intimacy of a whispered dialogue, the energy of a live performance, or the vastness of a cinematic soundscape, Sal approaches every project with the same guiding principle: to serve the story and bring out its emotional core.&quot;,
