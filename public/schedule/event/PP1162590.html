  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>XR is booming… Or is it? How secure are business models in the interactive/immersive sector and how well do they support creators to have social impact? And how do you thrive - not just survive - as a creator, producer, developer of this type of work, right now? Acknowledging challenges and uncertainty but also highlighting opportunities, the panel reflect on their own journeys - including successes, challenges and startings-over - to explore alternative models and offer practical advice for creators and producers to make work that matters: including protecting your IP and your wellbeing.</p>

Supported by Agog Media Institute, I am researching alternative approaches to VR Facilitation through the development of a framework called Immersive Story Club. This is about the art of the gather and the role of in person leadership in sharing award-winning VR films.  \n\nPreviously I was part of the Atlas V/ ASTREA team helping spearhead distribution in the XR industry. I enjoy exploring worlds where arts and community exist that are disconnected from institutional support. I&#39;m interested in working with XR Artists, nonprofits, universities, libraries and cultural institutions. \n\nSome of the award-winning projects include: Notes on Blindness (2016), Blind Vaysha (2017), Ayahuasca (2019), Battlescar (2019), Gloomy Eyes (2020), Madrid Noir (2021), The Dawn of Art (2019), On the Morning You Wake (2022), Missing Pictures (2022), Wallace and Gromit: the Grand Getaway (2023), Flow (2023), All I Know About Teacher Li (2024), Inter(Mediate) Spaces (2026), Insider-Outsider (2026) ++.&quot;,
