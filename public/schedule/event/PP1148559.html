      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;James P. Allison, Ph.D., the 2018 Nobel Laureate for Physiology or Medicine, has spent a distinguished career studying the regulation of T cell responses and pioneering new strategies for cancer immunotherapy. He is Regental Professor and Chair of Immunology, Executive Director of the Immunotherapy Platform and Director of the James P. Allison Institute at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Work in his lab led to the development of ipilimumab, the first immune checkpoint blockade therapy approved by the FDA, which launched the field of cancer immunotherapy and has since been approved to treat multiple cancer types. Through the Allison Institute, he seeks to improve the use of immunotherapies and identify new targets to unleash the immune system to eradicate cancer.&quot;,
