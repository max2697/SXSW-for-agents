      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Eric Ingram is an entrepreneur and systems strategist focused on how humanity navigates its next frontiers. Through his advisory platform, Ingram Insights, he works with founders, investors, and institutions operating at the edge of technology, where capital, regulation, risk, and human capability intersect. His work centers on building resilient systems, reducing hidden failure points, and helping leaders make clearer decisions before consequences force clarity. He is a frequent speaker and has appeared on national television and major media platforms to discuss space, leadership, and accessibility.\n\nHe is the founder of Scout Space, where he led the company through its formative years at the intersection of orbital safety, commercial space, and national security. He is also a leader in inclusive spaceflight through his work with AstroAccess, advancing microgravity research and expanding who can participate in space exploration. Outside the boardroom, Eric is a pilot and a competitive wheelchair rugby athlete. Both reinforce his belief that performance and accessibility strengthen each other. Across companies, research, and public forums, his work asks a central question: how do we expand who gets to shape the future while maintaining rigor, safety, and ambition?&quot;,
