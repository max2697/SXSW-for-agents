  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Bio: Saint Harison is a rising artist with an undeniable voice from Southampton, United Kingdom. He currently lives in Los Angeles, CA. Having quickly risen to Internet fame from public support from SZA and Jazmine Sullivan to Justin Bieber, Timbaland and Elton John, he’s one of the latest artists to watch. Citing Amy Winehouse and Frank Ocean as two key musical influences, Saint has been covered by Rolling Stone, British Vogue, Wonderland, etc. and was named Apple Music&#39;s global Up Next artist. He made his late night TV debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live! after his viral COLORS performance of “ego talkin,” which sparked the viral #egotalkinchallenge on TikTok. His 7-track EP lost a friend was released in 2023 and has amassed over 200M cumulative streams, continuing to grow. He returned in fall 2025 with his single &quot;ghosted,&quot; and recently released his latest single &quot;bad,&quot; produced by Grammy-winning producer duo NovaWav (Beyoncé, JAY-Z, Jazmine Sullivan, etc.). He&#39;s gearing up to release his highly anticipated project this year.</p>
