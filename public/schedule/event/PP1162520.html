  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Aging is often framed as an old person&#39;s problem. But millions of young people in America are already affected, with 3.6 million youth ages 15–22 caring for loved ones with little support, and over 7% of young workers’ earnings go to Social Security and Medicare, despite having minimal trust those benefits will be there for them as they age.

This conversation will challenge and embolden attendees to see aging as a multigenerational issue—calling on leaders to give younger generations a seat at the table and on young people to speak out to shape the future of America&#39;s social safety net.</p>
