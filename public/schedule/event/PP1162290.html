  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Today’s consumers are demanding more than just great products—they want brands that reflect their values and contribute to a cleaner planet and better world. A NielsenIQ study found that purpose-led products average 28% growth vs 20% for non-purpose-led products. From reducing plastic waste to promoting a regenerative world, hear from organizations at the forefront of the sustainability movement who are rewriting the rules of business, driving growth through purpose, and proving that conscious capitalism isn’t just a trend, but the future we’re moving towards—brands can thrive by doing good.</p>
