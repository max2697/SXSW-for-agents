  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As much as we&#39;d like to think that splurgy new car and our Prime Day shopping carts are the fruits of reason, purchases big and small aren’t governed by logic. People purchase based on who they are, how they feel and what surrounds them at the time. Humans are &#39;Unreasonable by Nature,&#39; and this panel will illustrate how to grow brands by aligning with the true psychological drivers of consumer decisions. Expert academics from leading American business schools, Ryan Hamilton, Alix Barasch and Keisha Cutright, will explore how rational marketing tactics often fail where unreasonable appeals win.</p>
