  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>While there are many recent examples of viral songs on social media launching major artist careers, chasing that viral hit isn’t always necessarily sustainable or the most feasible way for an artist to go about building long term success. Rather than solely focusing on going viral, there are several other areas an artist can look at for building their career such as defining their unique brand and sound, consistently releasing high quality music, and building community. This session will dive into each of these areas to provide artists with realistic tips that they can apply to their careers.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Adam Gross, President of Ineffable Records, was born and raised in New York City, where he first fell in love with Caribbean music, gigging with his Jamaican friends. A 2018 Northwestern graduate, Adam joined Ineffable Music Group and pitched CEO Thomas Cussins on launching an in-house label that allowed artists to own their masters and retain creative control. In 2019, he founded Ineffable Records, which has since become Billboard’s top independent reggae label for six consecutive years, growing catalog revenue and streams by over 50% annually. Adam is recognized as a leading voice on artist independence and fanbase building, having worked with Stick Figure, Collie Buddz, Protoje, Sean Paul, The Elovaters, O.A.R., and more—focusing on sustainable growth rather than fleeting viral moments.&quot;,
