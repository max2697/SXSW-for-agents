      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Rebecca Rosenberg (2025 Forbes 30 Under 30) was born with low vision stemming from a rare disease called albinism. Inspired by the shortcomings she experienced with assistive tech growing up, Rebecca founded ReBokeh as a college student with the goal of leveraging mobile devices to support those with low vision. In the years since, ReBokeh has grown to achieve a global presence - with organizational partners across the US and users in 115 countries around the globe. Built by and for the low vision community, ReBokeh’s mobile technology empowers the 90% of blind and low vision individuals who retain some functional sight to use that sight, rather than defaulting away from it - allowing users to make specially-designed adjustments to a live camera feed to meet their unique visual needs.&quot;,
