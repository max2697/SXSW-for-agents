  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Born in 2001, Philadelphia ignited its very own genre-bending firecracker: Kayanne Peppa. Also known as “Bunnii,” Kayanne began her creative journey at a young age, exploring various arts, writing, orchestra, &amp; musical theater. Her curiosity later expanded into cosplay/design, &amp; music laying the foundation for the bold world she creates today. Inspired by her brother, she began recording her own raps on GarageBand in high school, transforming a playful hobby into something more. Her music now emerges from the depths of fearless self-expression, blending hip-hop grit, punk rebellion &amp; an unmistakable sense of play. With her animated and striking stage confidence, Kayanne Peppa turns every performance into an experience. Being instantly recognizable for her bunny ears, each show she lovingly gives them out to honor the memory of her beloved bunny, Kirby.Drawing inspiration from artists like Missy Elliott, Aaliyah, Michael Jackson, Avril Lavigne, Gwen Stefani to name a few, she refused to stay in one lane. To her life is one big anime, where exaggeration, bold looks, and unapologetic individuality are quite essential.Kayanne Peppa’s music is made for main characters only!</p>
