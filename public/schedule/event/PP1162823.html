  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Humanoids and robots are moving from science fiction to reality, and vision is key to that evolution. Just as our visual cortex allows humans to perceive and adapt, machine vision gives robots the ability to understand, navigate, and interact with the world around them. This session explores how advances in depth sensing, AI compute, and cloud-scale learning are giving humanoids and robots sight, safety, and awareness to operate naturally among us—and what that means for the future of human-robot interaction.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Jan is the founder and CEO of OpenMind, a tech company in San Francisco that is building \&quot;Android for humanoids”. Just like we all add new skills to our phones through Apps, humanoids will need a modular brain that allows specific skills to be added and improved, for maximum utility in homes, hospitals, schools, and workplaces.\r\rJan is an associate professor of Bioengineering at Stanford University. He started life as a physics professor at UC Berkeley, where he studied soft condensed matter physics and built hardware for trapping single molecules with light. He then became interested in data and computing on sensitive data. At Stanford, he tackles problems in healthcare and especially digital health. Since 2025, he has been helping to build an open source software stack for advanced human focused humanoids.&quot;,
