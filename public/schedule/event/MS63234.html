  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Atlanta based musician, Elijah Johnston, will release a brand new album, Stupid Soul, via Strolling Bones Records on June 20, 2025. 

Stupid Soul is either Elijah Johnston’s 4th record or his 7th, depending on who you ask, but possibly the first you’ve heard. The logical next step in a career of slow burns, Stupid Soul is neither a record of morose self-reflection nor a frenetic series of genre experiments, settling into a comfortable steady pace: a record built to fit like a glove.

Performed by a small team including Johnston’s brother, manager, and long-time producer, the record is full of small wonders and live band energy, the sound of four close-knit collaborators in pursuit of something timeless. 12-string acoustic guitars, vintage synthesizers, and a relentless belief in the guitar solo round out Johnston’s usual pop rock palate, and the team manages to make a coherent picture out of a mood board that takes just as many cues from Brian Wilson as it does from The Legend of Zelda. 

Elijah began his career in the legendary musical community of Athens, and he was the winner of that city’s 2022 Vic Chesnutt Songwriter of the Year Award. Since then, he has toured nationally and shared stages with acts like Noah Gundersen, Susto, and Elf Power, establishing a name as a recognized songwriter with a potent live show to match.</p>
