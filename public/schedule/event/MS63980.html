  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Fine Food Market is the folk dream-pop project of Montreal-based multi-disciplinary artist Sophie Perras. Drawing from her training as a classical pianist and inspired by the sound of her beloved PSR3000 keyboard, the songs of Fine Food Market are intuitive, emotional, and fun.

Fine Food Market builds from the rudiments of country-folk and the experimental tendencies of the indie genre to articulate a musical place filled with sunny fields, old cars, and brightly painted houses.

Both eclectic and whimsical, the songs of Fine Food Market can also contain a real sadness, a feeling especially discoverable in her French lyrics. As a bilingual artist she unravels intimate and intricate musings in her own language, writing in a voice reserved for speaking to a close friend. Ultimately sincere, Fine Food Market may also pick up the tools of satire to describe difficult events of her own life.

Fine Food Market’s first EP, “I’m afraid to be in love with someone who crashes their car So much” was released in the beginning of March 2025 with Arbutus Records.</p>
