Remember to wear your sunglasses.“Wendigo” -- A lonely shapeshifter tries to make friends in a big forest.“She Follows Me” -- “She Follows Me” introduces Harper, a teenage girl struggling with depression who is contemplating suicide, until an unexpected visitor helps her rediscover a part of her life that she thought was gone forever.“Uno” -- When Derian cheats in a friendly game of Uno, his friend seeks revenge with the help of a magical Uno card. “Bear Bones” -- Bear Bones follows the surreal journey of a teddy bear.“DASH’D” -- A regular dude can&#39;t decide what to order on a food delivery app.“Operation Goliath” -- Two soldiers, Pat and Hank, are trapped behind enemy lines in a dense jungle, but a new threat is waiting in the darkness.“New Heights – with JD Wallace – New Heights follows Joshua” -- “JD” Wallace, a 6’5” Jack Yates High School senior whose rise as a student-athlete challenges every assumption about him—revealing that true elevation isn’t just about height, but speed, precision, discipline, and purpose.“Hot Off the Reel - with Ken Burns” -- As Jack Yates High School approaches its 100-year anniversary, four JY Cinema Dual Credit students step into the world of professional documentary filmmaking when they meet legendary filmmaker Ken Burns at Houston PBS. “Gambini Fights Lucheesy (TONY???) and the Lucheeses: The Movie” -- Two omnipotent mafia bosses engage in a fierce battle for the perfect croissant recipe.Following the final film, there will be a Q&amp;A with the audience featuring the student filmmakers.</p>
