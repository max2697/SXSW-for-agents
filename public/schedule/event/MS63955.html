  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Crisp harmonies, dual lead guitars, and a rhythm section built on drums, bass, and keys makes up The Gasoline Gypsies. But, their recent exponential growth is born of a work ethic that has earned them the reputation one of the tightest bands in Michigan.
Music built to serve the songs, drawing influence from the roots of rock, folk, bluegrass, and country, The Gasoline Gypsies craft a unique style of Americana Rock; Music painting images of the wonder of nature while engaging thoughtful, and mature poetry, spinning themes that invite us to an understanding of our common human journey. A Gasoline Gypsies show asks us to breathe in all of the world, and exhale a unifying message of realistic hope, celebrating both life’s challenges and joys, reminding us that amid the ebb and flow of life, we are all on this ride together.
The Gasoline Gypsies plugged in can rock large venues. Unplugged they can enchant small rooms.
The Eight time Detroit Music Award winners are feverishly followed by their loyal fan tribe, The Vagabundos. Meet a Vagabundo, and you’ll likely be enchanted by an alchemy that draws together the music, the people, and the family that is The Gasoline Gypsies experience.
