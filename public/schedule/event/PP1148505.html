  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Advanced tech is quickly expanding the ways we can support teachers and students both in and out of the classroom. But how do we design and fund programs that turn potential into impact? This panel explores how setting bold, time-bound learning goals can accelerate and level-up innovation while catalyzing impactful financial support. From coordinated research programs to targeted funding strategies, this session will explore how moonshot-centered models can rally diverse innovators around a shared outcome, encourage rigorous validation, and accelerate breakthroughs for teaching and learning.</p>
