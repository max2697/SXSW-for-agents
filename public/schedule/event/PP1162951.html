  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Creators face a growing “sound barrier”: a fragmented ecosystem of tools, platforms, and services that often makes creating feel more complicated than it should be. What should be intuitive and fluid can become complex, costly, and disconnected.

This panel explores what a more unified, creator-first space for music and podcast creation could look like that meets creators where they are in the journey. Whether its beginners  or more experienced creators refining their craft, we’ll explore more streamlined solutions for music and podcasts that support creators at every stage.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;\rThe rebellious nature of Taylor Felt is woven into the DNA of her music. Her unapologetic lyrics \r\rare embedded into every song she writes, while the production lays the foundation for \r\reverything from electrifying anthems to sentimental songbook moments from the heart. She \r\rrecently released “MOVE A LITTLE”, a dance‑driven pop record that marks the first release from \r\rher upcoming EP later this year, garnering editorial supporting. Her debut EP, “Dead Flowers”, \r\rexceeded 250K Spotify streams in its first month and Taylor has organically grown a highly \r\rengaged audience of 3.2M+ followers across platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, \r\rSnapchat and Twitch.  \r\rIn 2020, she was recognized for her efforts and was selected as an official TikTok Ambassador, \r\rthe only music artist chosen, and attended the Grammys on behalf of the brand. Taylor was also \r\rthe co‑writer and featured artist alongside Jaden Smith in the title track of, “Life In A Year”, film \r\rstarring Jaden Smith and Cara Delevingne. As well as recently performed the National Anthem \r\rfor the NFL San Francisco 49ers this past December where she delivered powerful highs and \r\rsultry lows that took listeners on an emotional journey. \r\rHer second EP, still unannounced, is flourishing with lush production, big melodies, and \r\rcohesive storytelling that you can dance and heal to. A lifelong vocalist with a clear creative \r\rdirection and a desire to empower, Taylor Felt is destined to be a generational artist. &quot;,
