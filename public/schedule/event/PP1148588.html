  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Technology isn’t just accelerating progress, it&#39;s changing the very process of progress itself: product testing can happen virtually before building, clinical trials can be simulated before major lab investment, distribution can dictate where production happens. This session will change how you see every workflow in your business. You&#39;ll walk away armed with a practical framework that will help you learn how to identify inversions in your own industry. The future belongs to leaders who think in reverse.</p>
