  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Entrepreneurship is one of the last viable paths to economic mobility in America—offering ownership, stability, and long-term wealth. But that path is narrowing fast. Early-stage funding to women and underrepresented founders has dropped nearly 50% since 2020 (Crunchbase, 2023), while systems like childcare, capital access, and mentorship remain fragile. This session brings together cross-sector leaders to ask: What must we build now to keep entrepreneurship within reach for the next generation?</p>
