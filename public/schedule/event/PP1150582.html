      &quot;details&quot;: &quot; \rJamie Lee Curtis has built a nearly five-decade acting career that has only shined more brightly with time. She is also a passionate humanitarian and popular children’s book author, she has earned critical acclaim, major industry honors, and the admiration of generations of fans.\r\r \r\rIn Everything Everywhere All at Once in 2022, she won the Academy Award and SAG Award for Best Supporting Actress, along with Golden Globe and Independent Spirit Award nominations. In 2024, she earned an Emmy for her guest-star appearance on the acclaimed Hulu series The Bear and an Emmy nomination in the same category the following year.  In 2021, she received the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the Venice Film Festival. \r\r \r\rCurtis recently appeared in Freakier Friday (2025), the 22-years-in-the-making sequel to Disney’s Freaky Friday, for which she previously earned a Golden Globe nomination. Other standout roles include True Lies (1994), for which she won a Golden Globe; Trading Places (1983), which earned her a BAFTA (British Film Academy Award); and A Fish Called Wanda (1988), which garnered both BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations.\r\r \r\rCurtis’ film debut in the 1978 horror classic Halloween brought her to international attention. She returned for the record-breaking 2018 sequel, whose opening weekend was the biggest debut ever for a movie featuring a female lead over age 55. That success was followed by Halloween Kills (2021) and Halloween Ends (2022). Other film credits include Ella McCay,  Knives Out; Christmas with the Kranks; The Tailor of Panama; Blue Steel; My Girl; and My Girl 2, among many others. Television highlights include two seasons of Scream Queens, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination; the acclaimed sitcom Anything but Love, bringing her a Golden Globe and People’s Choice Award; TNT’s adaptation of The Heidi Chronicles, earning her a Golden Globe nomination; and the CBS television film Nicholas’ Gift, for which she received an Emmy nomination.\r\r \r\rIn 2019, Curtis formed Comet Pictures, a film, television, and podcast production company. Comet&#39;s upcoming projects include the Amazon Prime Video series Scarpetta with Blumhouse starring Nicole Kidman and Curtis, which debuts in March 2026. Their most recent production, released in September 2025, was The Lost Bus for Apple Original Films, which Curtis co-produced with Jason Blum, with whom she has a first look deal. \r\rShe has also produced STOP THE INSANITY the Susan Powter story and SENDER which is having its World Premiere in competition at SXSW.\r\rShe was founder and CEO of My Hand In Yours, a charitable organization that in five years raised nearly $2 million benefitting Children&#39;s Hospital Los Angeles. Curtis is also a New York Times best-selling children’s book author with 14 titles, the most recent being Just One More Sleep (2024).&quot;,
