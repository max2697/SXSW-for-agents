In this talk, you&#39;ll hear real stories of bold ideas that went from &quot;no way&quot; to &quot;how did they do that?&quot; It&#39;s a rallying cry for creators and leaders to stop self-editing, embrace bold thinking, and protect the unthinkable—because that’s where the magic (and real impact) happens.</p>
