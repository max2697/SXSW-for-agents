  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Generative AI has rapidly advanced in text, imagery, and 3D content, but its potential to shape the physical world remains largely untapped. This panel explores how AI can be used to generate designs for things that can be built, manufactured, or constructed, spanning products, machines, buildings, and infrastructure. Experts in computational design, AI research, and digital fabrication will discuss current challenges, technical hurdles, and the foundational work needed to unlock future impact and bring generative design into the realm of the physical.</p>
