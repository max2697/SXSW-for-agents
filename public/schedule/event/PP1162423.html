  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As Gen Z enters the workforce during a time of cultural, technological, and workplace change, the need for career-building spaces that reflect our realities has never been more urgent. The lines between brand, communications, and content continue to blur. Gen Z professionals are being asked to think holistically across platforms, communities, and culture, often without clear mentorship or support. This session will spotlight how we, as young professionals, can build meaningful careers and elevate the standard for inclusive, cross-disciplinary brand storytelling in the process.</p>
