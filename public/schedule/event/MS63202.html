  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Knats, a quintet led by two lifelong best mates from Newcastle Upon Tyne, Stan Woodward (Bass) and King David-Ike Elechi (Drums), alongside their younger sidekick and virtuoso Trumpeter, Ferg Kilsby, making Geordie Jazz, with sophisticated arrangements, strong melodies and danceable grooves.

After moving to London at the end of 2022, Knats took London by storm playing sold out jazz re:freshed and Rough Trade East headliners, supporting Str4ta at a sold Jazz Cafe and performing for the BBC proms; as well as working with and backing the likes of Geordie Greep, Eddie Chacon, Yellowdays and collaborating with major fashion brands Palace, Beams and Arc’teryx. Following their signing to Gearbox Records at the beginning of 2024, Knats released their debut self-titled album in March of 2025 and embarked on their first UK headline tour. From this they went on to receive critical acclaim from the likes of Jazzwise, Downbeat, Rolling Stone Japan, The Guardian and many more; as well as being nominated for ‘Jazz Newcomer of the Year’ at this year’s Parliamentary Jazz Awards.</p>
