  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>While most schools banned AI when it first emerged, one school in Hawai‘i saw the wave coming and started paddling early. As the emerging technology teacher at ‘Iolani School, my goal was to make every mistake as quickly as possible so that we can learn valuable lessons together. We knew from day one that AI was here to stay, so while others watched from shore, my students and I were wiping out, experimenting, and figuring it out together. This session shares the stories from those chaotic early days and how they led to the AI literacy programs we’ve built in Hawai‘i today.</p>
