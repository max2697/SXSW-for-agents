  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Twenty years ago, the music industry faced an existential crisis. Piracy was reshaping consumption, the old model was unraveling, and no clear path forward existed. Spotify was born from a simple but radical belief: that technology could reconnect artists and fans in a way that worked for both. Join Gustav for a look at the future of Spotify’s technological transformation across music, podcasts, and audiobooks, exploring how user control, creator innovation, and thoughtful technology are shaping the next chapter of entertainment.</p>
