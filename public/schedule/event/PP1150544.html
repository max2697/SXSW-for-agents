  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Everyone&#39;s talking about AI agents, but what actually happens when companies deploy them to do real work? This live recording of the &quot;Making a Mind&quot; podcast explores the gap between how we think agentic AI should work and how it actually behaves in the wild. Cognitive scientist and podcast host Dr. Danielle Perszyk sits down with Michael Giannangeli, head of product, agentic AI for Amazon Nova, plus industry voices from Amanda Doerr, vice president of core shopping at Amazon and more who&#39;ve recently launched agents into production. Together, they&#39;ll dissect real implementation stories—the successes, the surprises, and the moments where human expectations collided with AI reality. We&#39;ll explore the fundamental questions emerging as AI agents become collaborators: Where do humans want control versus autonomy? How do we build trust with systems whose reasoning we can&#39;t see? And how does cognitive science research translate into product decisions—from tool-calling architecture to the design choices that determine when agents act independently versus ask for help? This isn&#39;t a demo. It&#39;s an honest conversation about what we&#39;re learning as agentic AI moves from theory to practice—and what it reveals about both artificial and human intelligence.</p>
