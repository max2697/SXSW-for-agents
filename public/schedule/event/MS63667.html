  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Camille Schmidt is a Brooklyn-based songwriter who writes with the kind of emotional clarity most people spend their lives avoiding. Her songs are known for their near mythic ability to turn confession into something communal. 

With her debut album Nude #9 (2025), Schmidt renders revealing portraits of herself, friends, exes (all real names used), and strangers encountered in passing: a rambling OBGYN, a woman reading breakup texts on a plane, a Reiki healer who ends a session early after claiming Schmidt’s blue aura is overwhelming. Schmidt reminds us here that she is, at her core, a storyteller. 

Sonically, Nude #9 abandons allegiance to genre. Moving beyond the folk-rooted approach of Good Person, Schmidt folds synthesizers, sequencers, and post-punk rhythms into her writing. The album appeared on multiple Best Albums of 2025 lists, with critics describing Schmidt as one of indie music’s “most important rising voices.” The cult-like devotion forming around her work has become a defining part of her momentum, increasingly evident in the way her songs translate from record to room. Schmidt is now at work on new music.</p>
