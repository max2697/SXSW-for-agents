  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>someshiit is a Taiwanese hip-hop artist known for his unique blend of bedroom rap and live band arrangements. Drawing influence from UK, Japanese, and Korean hip-hop, he emerged in 2019 with the breakout single  “Those Who Told Me to Quit Smoking Are All Dead” (5M+ views on YouTube), the track’s poetic and raw storytelling quickly resonated with a new generation of listeners. His debut album ‘A FOOL’ pushed even further, fusing gritty lyricism with lush, genre-blurring production alongside collaborators like Samjoo (deca joins), Sam Yang, and Pei-Yu Hung, earning him Best New Artist at the Golden Melody Awards, Taiwan’s most prestigious music honor.
From TV screens “The Rappers 2” to major Taiwanese festival stages like Megaport, Vagabond, and FireBall Fest, he weaves lush live-band arrangements as the backbone of his sound, layered with razor-sharp, prose-like lyricism that cuts straight to the core. His self-produced shows consistently sell out, including his first overseas performance in Hong Kong, proving that his music’s emotional gravity transcends borders. Internationally, he has worked alongside acclaimed Japanese rapper maco marets and South Korean psychedelic band CHS, garnering attention from various media outlets and hip-hop labels. 

With a reimagined EP set to drop in 2025 marking six years since his breakout hit, someshiit isn’t just evolving, he’s shaping a new creative language for Mandarin rap, redefining its boundaries one verse at a time.</p>
