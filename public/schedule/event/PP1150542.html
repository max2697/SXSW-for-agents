  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Amid relentless technological disruption, global uncertainty and shifting work norms, most leaders know innovation is essential. But few know how to switch from generating bold ideas to scaling them across complex systems and industries. According to Harvard Business School professor Linda A. Hill, one of the world’s foremost experts on leadership and innovation, the answer is clear: innovation isn’t a solo act, but a collective one.Drawing on her new book, “Genius at Scale: How Great Leaders Drive Innovation,” as well as a decade of global research with co-authors Jason Wild and Emily Tedards, Hill introduces three critical roles that enable leaders to turn ideas into impact. Identifying the roles as the Architect, who builds culture and capacilites for co-creation; the Bridger, who facilitates partnerships across organizational boundaries; and the Catalyst, who sparks movements that sustain innovation at scale, Hill and Tedards demonstrate how leaders can harness digital tools, data and cross-sector collaboration to scale innovation and impact.Through powerful case studies spanning industries from technology to healthcare to hospitality, Hill demonstrates how leaders can harness digital tools, data and cross-sector collaboration to transform experimentation into execution. Leaders leave this session equipped with actionable frameworks and a renewed understanding of how to build environments where creativity thrives, collaboration flourishes and innovation becomes everyone’s job.</p>
