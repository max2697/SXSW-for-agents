  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Prissy P is a Bay Area–raised DJ and curator based in Austin, TX. Shaped by Northern California’s cultural diversity, her sound blends R&amp;B, hip hop, reggaeton, Afrobeats, and global rhythms into sets rooted in feeling, movement, and connection.

She is an active presence in Austin’s music scene, DJing across nightlife, corporate events, and large-scale community activations, including athletic and wellness-driven experiences. Her ability to move fluidly between nightlife and daytime environments reflects her range as both a DJ and curator.

Outside the club, Prissy P focuses on music in open-air and daytime settings. Through projects like Picnic Beats and Vitamin R&amp;B, she creates spaces where sunshine, music, and nature come together. As someone who navigates depression and anxiety, outdoor environments paired with music have been deeply grounding, turning personal rituals like beach days and picnics into shared experiences.

Her long-term goal is to become an MLB stadium DJ, specifically for the Los Angeles Dodgers. A lifelong baseball fan, she believes music is the heartbeat of a stadium, shaping energy, emotion, and collective memory.</p>
