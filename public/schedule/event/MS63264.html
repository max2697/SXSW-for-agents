  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Based in Athens, Georgia, Wim Tapley came of age playing venues in Washington D.C. and its sprawling suburbs. There, he honed his voice with the passion of a born troubadour, drawing in a diverse fanbase with his easy showmanship and distinct style.
 
Since 2021, Athens has been home to Wim and his live band The Cannons. His first week in town, Wim made his way onto a local bill, etching a name for himself as a fresh and favorite hometown voice. He is ardently received by his ever-growing following at legendary regional venues like the 9:30 Club, Eddie’s Attic, and the Georgia Theatre—the latter of which he’s sold out more than once—and on tours across the country.
 
Firmly rooted in Americana and dashed with glamorous pop sensibilities, the swinging depths of neo-soul, and a sprinkling of riotous horns, Wim’s arresting sound is as fresh as it is ageless, as fevered as it is raucous fun. 
 
A sonic westward expansion of fuzzed-out guitars, defiant horns, and dusty vocals, his discography blazes a fresh new take on folk-pop while honoring the songwriting giants that paved the way before him like Jason Isbell, Bill Withers, and Chris Stapleton. </p>
