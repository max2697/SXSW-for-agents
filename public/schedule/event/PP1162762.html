  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Practitioners from industry (Google), academia (Columbia-SIPA) and civil society (Access Now) will show how cybersecurity impacts human rights. Drawing on research with vulnerable and marginalized communities, including human rights defenders, independent journalists, and the elderly, they will show how people in diverse circumstances attempt to navigate digital spaces safely and freely with few resources. They will offer lessons and debate best practices and norms in cyber capacity-building, corporate human rights due diligence, and technology-informed advocacy from an intersectional lens.</p>
