  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Data centers are the invisible engines behind AI, streaming, and cloud computing—but their carbon and resource footprints are growing fast. Decarbonizing these energy-hungry systems takes more than clean power; it requires a full-scale rethink of how we design, build, power, cool, and manage digital infrastructure. This panel brings together leaders in carbon capture, battery storage, green building, water management, and high-performance infrastructure to explore how we can decarbonize the digital world—from the foundations up.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Breana Wheeler became BRE&#39;s Director of Operations in the US in June 2016. BRE is a 100-year-old building science research organization that delivers innovative and rigorous products, services, standards and qualifications which are used around the globe to make buildings better for people and for the environment.\n\nBRE developed BREEAM, the world’s first and leading science-based suite of standards defining and validating sustainability performance in the built environment. Since 1990, BREEAM’s standards have helped improve asset performance at every stage, from design through construction, to use and renovation. Millions of buildings across the world are registered to work towards BREEAM’s holistic approach to design, construct and operate sustainable buildings and 750,000+ certificates have been issued for assets in over 100 countries.\n\nBreana oversees the deployment of the BREEAM family of standards in the US, including BREEAM USA In-Use for existing buildings. In addition to market development, she supports technical work on Resilience and Social Impact and developing these themes within all BREEAM standards globally.  Prior to joining BRE, Breana worked for ten years as an internal advisor on environmental and sustainability risk management for large, multinational corporations.\n\nBreana is a Member of the Institute of Sustainability &amp;amp; Environmental Professionals (ISEP, formerly IEMA) and a Chartered Environmentalist (CEnv) with the Society for the Environment.\n\nShe earned her a double Bachelor degree in Geography and Political Science from San Francisco State University and a Masters in Environment, Politics and Globalization from Kings College London.&quot;,
