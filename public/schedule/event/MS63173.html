  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Buddy Red is the Southern blues artist delivering the raw, cinematic sound of the Black American experience. A vocalist, guitarist, and preacher of truth, he stands where the cosmic mystique of Jimi Hendrix meets the uncompromising funk of James Brown and the psychedelic scope of Pink Floyd. A fixture of Atlanta&#39;s legendary Northside Tavern, Buddy is a vital voice recognized for his visceral guitar work and impassioned storytelling, captivating live and digital audiences alike.

Since his breakout debut at SXSW, which included a featured set at The Shade Room&#39;s activation in 2023, his momentum is undeniable. He recently performed at the James Brown Estate for the Black Music Action Coalition’s Juneteenth celebration and shared the stage with Little Richard&#39;s original band at Tutti Frutti Music Festival. His new single, &quot;Sold His Soul,&quot; cemented his rise as a cinematic blues revivalist, with his cultural influence extending through partnerships with the Atlanta Hawks and BMW and a festival performance at Neon Prarie in Tulsa. Buddy Red is returning to SXSW as an essential force.</p>
