      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Joey Clift is a Los Angeles-based comedian, Peabody and Emmy nominated TV writer and an enrolled member of the Cowlitz Indian Tribe. Growing up, Joey aspired to become a local TV weatherperson because he didn’t see Native American comedians on screen and thought a career in comedy was off-limits. He has since proven otherwise, with his comedy featured in The Washington Post, CNN, Dropout, Pitchfork, NPR, Dead Meat, and Comedy Central.\n\nAs a television writer Joey has written for shows such as Spirit Rangers on Netflix, Molly of Denali and Alma’s Way on PBS, New Looney Tunes and Lego Ninjago: Decoded on Cartoon Network, and Paw Patrol and Rubble &amp;amp; Crew on Nickelodeon. Joey created Gone Native, a Webby Award-winning Comedy Central Digital series about weird microaggressions Native folks often experience. His short films have screened everywhere from Just For Laughs to the Smithsonian Museum.&quot;,
