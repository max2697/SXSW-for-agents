  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Fresh from a seminal performance at All Together Now’s Last City stage, Sugaboo is set to make a statement as he has sold 450 tickets to his debut headline show in the Iconic Dublin venue Whelans.  From forwarded many times WhatsApp releases to 12K monthly Spotify listeners, Sugaboo has been building a buzz in the Dublin underground. His debut mixtape “Kimmagination” released in August 2025 has garnered attention from Kneecap’s Moglai Bap who endorsed the album on instagram.  When the Irish ex-Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is a follower. Lewis Capaldi is an early fan aswell and has been playing Goin Ballistic to the crowds before his arena shows on his recent UK tour.

Earlier this year, Sugaboo featured on Lil Skag’s “Pilgirmmage to Kimmage,” which received Track of the Week on the Nialler9 blog. With a collaborative mixtape with Lil Skag, “Skagaboo,” on the horizon. 

Sugaboo’s momentum is building now. Having opened for Mik Pyro of Republic of Loose fame to a sold-out crowd in Whelan’s main room, Sugaboo has proven his live credentials. With a string of shows under his belt, having toured Ireland and the UK. Expect live versions of the tracks you’ve had on repeat, plus a few surprises. Bring the crew, bring the energy. This isn’t just a show – it’s a statement of raw energy. Dublin 12 inside the place; real bars, no industry fluff, No hype merchants, no messing just a room full of heads who’ve been watching this build from the shack days.</p>
