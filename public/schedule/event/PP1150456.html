  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>After unnerving the populace of the West Side of Los Angeles on Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David and Jeff Schaffer decided to cast a wider net on a grander subject - the History of the United States.

In honor of America’s 250th anniversary they have teamed up with the Obamas and Higher Ground for a historical sketch comedy series debuting on HBO this summer.

Larry and Jeff will discuss their process for Curb and the similarities and differences in making their new series - including a sneak peak of never-before-seen footage from the new show. And if you decide to walk out in the middle of it, they will completely understand.

Moderated by Lorraine Ali</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Jeff Schaffer doesn’t want to talk about all the work he’s done. Don’t get him wrong, he wants you to know about it, and he really wants the adulation, but he doesn’t want to have to tell you himself and seem like a braggart.\r\rHe would love you to know that he’s spent a large portion of his adult life working with Larry David - writing and then producing four seasons of Seinfeld with his partner Alec\rBerg, eventually helping to run the show until it was cruelly cancelled. And he wants you to hear all about how he has worked on Curb Your Enthusiasm since Season 5 as a writer, director and executive producer. But he can’t tell you any of this. How cheesy do you think he is?\r\rHe’s also worked on movies that he would love to be commended for, including Eurotrip, Clear History, and traveling around the world with Sacha Baron Cohen writing and producing Bruno and The Dictator. These are the highlights. Lowlights are available upon request.\r\rAnd of course he wants you to know that he and his wife, Jackie, also created and ran the show The League for seven seasons. And co-created and EP’d the series Dave. But he can’t just come right out and say it. That would smack of desperation.\r\rThough his schedule has been hectic, Jeff has still found the time to regret this bio. He thinks the third person angle is bullshit and he sounds a bit full of himself.&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Larry David co-created “Seinfeld,” which debuted in 1989 and ran for nine seasons. As head writer and executive producer, the pressure of delivering a weekly show led to his abuse of anabolic steroids, which contributed to his ill-temper and shrunken testicles. In 1999, HBO aired his one-hour special, “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” which spawned the 12-season series. In it, he plays an incredibly gifted, loveable writer who spreads bonhomie and good cheer to everyone fortunate enough to encounter him. During one of “Curb’s” many, long hiatuses, David created two new shows, “Girls” and “Orange is the New Black.” To better understand the motivation of his female characters, he began cross-dressing and moved into the Barbizon Hotel for Women. He was evicted after his true identity was uncovered when he evacuated naked from a fire started by his roommate who forgot to unplug her curling iron. After a spiritual sabbatical in Poland, he returned to the US in 2009 to star in Woody Allen’s comedy, “Whatever Works.” The movie garnered David the prestigious Gottlieb Award for “Best Actor with No Training and No Idea What He Was Doing.” Then in 2013, he co-wrote and starred in the HBO Films’ comedy, “Clear History,” elevating him to cult hero status amongst illiterates and diabetics. In 2015, he made his Broadway debut at the Cort Theater as an actor and playwright in “Fish in the Dark,” which he penned over a three-day span while sitting on the toilet. The play broke all Broadway records for most coughing by an audience during a performance. He’s currently pursuing his real estate license and can be contacted through the Inland Empire branch of “Century 21.\&quot;&quot;,
