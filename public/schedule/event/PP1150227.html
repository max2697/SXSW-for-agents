      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Taylor Ellison is an Emmy Award–winning television host, producer, and meditationguide with more than a decade of on-air experience. Based in Austin, she created and executive produced Austin After Hours, a Lone Star Emmy–winning late-night entertainment show on CBS Austin. She was the former co-host of We Are Austin, a daily live lifestyle show, where she connected with viewers through inspiring interviews, uplifting stories, and community spotlights.\r\rShe has covered red carpets for E! News, hosted live at Formula 1, interviewed talent at press junkets from Los Angeles to New York, and produced and hosted a web series for Electrify News, among other creative ventures. She is currently developing a new television project that blends her passion for storytelling with her love of holistic living.\r\rOutside of the studio, Taylor facilitates meditation classes and events throughout Austin. She also works one-on-one with clients, helping cultivate self-compassion and intentional living practices. Passionate about uplifting voices in the arts and media, Taylor serves on the boards of the Paramount Theatre and Women in Film &amp; Television Austin. She also co-chaired the host committee for the ConnectHER Film Festival, an annual celebration of young female filmmakers.\r\rYou can follow Taylor on Instagram at @taylok, read her recent interview with Gary Clark Jr. and Nicole Trunfio for TRIBEZA, or revisit past seasons of Austin After Hours on YouTube. A proud Texas Longhorn, Taylor loves cheering on her alma mater, listening to live music, singing karaoke at Ego’s, enjoying margaritas on a sunny Austin patio and trying to help spread a little more joy.\r&quot;,
