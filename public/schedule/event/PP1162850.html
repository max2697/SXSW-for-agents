  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The climate crisis is now a public health emergency. Heatwaves, floods, and droughts are worsening chronic conditions and disrupting healthcare infrastructure. This panel brings together global experts in health, science, and technology to showcase real-world solutions that are strengthening health system resilience—from predictive models using climate and health data to AI tools and digital platforms enabling remote care in vulnerable regions. Technology can be the bridge between collapse and adaptation.</p>
