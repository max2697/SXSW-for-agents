  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>If you’ve ever been underestimated or overlooked you’ll know that success is the best revenge. Madison Tevlin (a trailblazer with Down syndrome who was told at birth by doctors she wouldn’t amount to much) and Ashley Callingbull (who is a First Nations Activist and the first Indigenous Sports Illustrated Model) will share stories of how they used haters, doubt, and being underestimated as even stronger fuel for chasing their dreams and creating change.
