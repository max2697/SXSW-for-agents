      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Girl Tones, of planet Earth, are a high-energy rock duo brought to life by two sisters named Kenzie and\rLaila. Both classically trained musicians, Kenzie transitioned from cello to guitar and Laila from piano to\rdrums in an effort to electrify sentient beings from this galaxy to the next. Their debut releases were\rproduced by Brad Shultz of Cage The Elephant and released via his label Parallel Vision in partnership\rwith Big Loud Rock.\rTheir first offerings have earned the praise of Rolling Stone, VICE, Consequence, PAPER, NME, DORK and\rmany others with Flaunt saying, “Their sound is fluid, and yet with each release, they evolve as a\rharmonious group, developing their unique sound as one.”\rIn their short but mighty existence, the duo has become synonymous with riotous live shows. Girl Tones\rhas toured with Cage The Elephant across the globe, as well as The Velveteers, hey, nothing. and\rSilversun Pickups across North America. Making their unignorable festival debut at Lollapalooza this\rsummer, Rolling Stone said, “While the White Stripes — their most obvious comparison — were about\rcontrolled energy, Girl Tones are proudly imperfect.”\rThe coming months will see more new music, including the release of the upcoming single “Cherry\rPicker.” The band can also be seen on tour dates alongside Silversun Pickups and Cage The Elephant, as\rwell as upcoming festival performances at Shaky Knees, Austin City Limits, 97x’s Next Big Thing and\rLegends and more.&quot;,
