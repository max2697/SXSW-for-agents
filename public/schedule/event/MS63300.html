  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>With combined streams of over 100 million and a dedicated online following, Morgan is doing things her way. Morgan began performing at just three years old and by eighteen she’d joined Rudimental as a globally-touring vocalist. Her solo debut ‘My Year’ spotlit her brand of sparkling pop, before a collaboration with Ebenezer (‘Mulholland Drive’) earned her over 10 million streams. Her subsequent EP ‘Alien’ referenced golden-era pop. That same year, ‘ADCT’ (written when she was 17) soared to the #1 spot on both TikTok Trending Sounds and the UK Top 50, earning over 30 million streams. Morgan also co-wrote and featured on Rudimental &amp; Digga D’s ‘Be the One’, Sigma’s ‘Adrenaline Rush’ and Purple Disco Machine&#39;s most recent album.  She’s been writing for some of the biggest K-pop artists (including NCT’s Jaehyun, TWICE &amp; Aespa).

Morgan released her EP ‘Emotional Gangster’ last October and went on to sell out her first UK headline tour at the end of the year including a show at London’s iconic Jazz Cafe. She turned up the heat with the release of ‘One Man’ featuring the legendary Beenie Man, paired with the unapologetic anthem ‘Bad Gyal Energy’.</p>
