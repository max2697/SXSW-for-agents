  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Sorry Youth is a power trio formed by guitarist Weni, bassist Giang Giang, and drummer Chung-Han. Taiwanese lyrics are an essential base of their songwriting as well as a hallmark of Sorry Youth, and the song arrangements capture a strong sense of live performance. They have established one of the unique features of the Taiwanese-rock sound nowadays with the essence of their music that is deeply influenced by bands from the 80s and 90s, such as The Cure, Sonic Youth, Yo La Tengo, Mogwai, The National, and Wilco, etc.

As one of the leading acts in Taiwan’s independent music scene, Sorry Youth has sold out numerous headline shows and performed at major festivals including Summer Sonic (JP), Megaport Festival (TW), Shima Fes SETOUCHI (JP), Mori Michi Ichiba (JP), and SXSW (US). Their international tours have taken them across Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Hong Kong, among others. 

As they enter their 20th year, Sorry Youth continues to expand their global reach, with upcoming performances at CLANG Music Festival 2025 (SG), Busan International Rock Festival (KR), and a new Japan tour in 2025.</p>
