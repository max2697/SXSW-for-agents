  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Haters are an Australian indie punk/garage band formed by Jai Sparks (vocals/guitar), James Priest (drums), and Kaito (Kaitlyn Hold – bass/vocals). For fans of Fontaines D.C., The Beths, IDLES, and Wunderhorse. Their songs are drenched in emotion and exist to make you feel something, they speak of real life, friendship, mental health, profound loss and the beauty of the human experience.

The band travelled to Canada to record their debut album non-violent with Scott Middleton (Cancer Bats), capturing their intense, unfiltered sound. Known for their high-energy live shows, Haters have performed at Bigsound (Australia), NXNE (Toronto), Sled Island (Calgary), and completed several cross-country Canadian tours.

Their debut album non-violent was released in March 2025, accompanied by sold-out shows throughout Canada and Australia accompanied by rapid growth across streaming and fan engagement, with listenership led by the US, followed by Canada and Australia, 1000&#39;s of playlist adds and major Apple Music and Spotify editorial support.
With a fierce commitment to honesty, connection, and powerful performances, Haters continue to build momentum as a force in the indie punk scene.</p>
