  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Your AI assistant has the keys to everything – email, finances, sensitive systems – but operates in shadows you can&#39;t see, a problem that continues to grow as companies unleash agentic AI faster than they can build safeguards. This panel will explore how AI agents are changing the way we think about work and how we trust technology. We&#39;ll ask: What happens when an AI assistant, designed to help, accidentally (or intentionally) steps out of line? How do we even know what they&#39;re up to when they operate independently? And how can we stop AI agents from becoming the next insider threat?</p>
