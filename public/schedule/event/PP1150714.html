      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Chelsea Ellis Bloch and Marisol Roncali co-founded Atomic Honey in early 2019, naming it in tribute to their first casting director credits on Atomic Blonde and Honey Boy. Their collaboration began while working on Deadpool 2, with Chelsea serving as Director of Feature Casting at Fox and Marisol as an independent Casting Director. Recognizing the need for a new, fresh voice in the industry, they combined their strong relationships with agents and managers, a reputation for discovering and nurturing emerging talent, and a shared passion for working with visionary filmmakers. Together, they quickly established themselves as go-to casting directors for innovative, character-driven projects.\r\rAtomic Honey’s film credits include DC Entertainment’s Blue Beetle; Blue Bayou, an Un Certain Regard selection at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, and Emily the Criminal, for which they received a Casting Society of America Award for Best Low-Budget Feature.\r\rTheir work also includes A24’s Tony and Eternity, Netflix’s Carry On, and Kristen Stewart’s directorial debut, The Chronology of Water, which was also an Un Certain Regard selection at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival.\r\rOn the television side, they have cast the Apple TV+ limited series Lady in the Lake, Peacock’s The Continental: From the World of John Wick, as well as The Edge of Sleep for Amazon Prime.\r\rChelsea is based in Los Angeles, while Marisol is based in New York City.&quot;,
