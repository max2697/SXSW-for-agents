He helped lead Honest Tea to a successful exit to Coca-Cola in 2011 and is now the Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Good Culture, a brand that disrupted the cottage cheese category in 2015.

Now in over 16,000 stores, Good Culture has nearly tripled sales in the last three years, becoming a top-selling brand across several key retailers and bringing new relevance to the category by attracting millennials and Gen Z consumers.&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Brad took the helm of ALOHA in 2017 as CEO and “Re-Founder,” driving its transformation from a struggling startup to a highly profitable, nationally recognized brand. His success as a leader stems from his founder-operator balanced mindset—combining entrepreneurial vision with operational expertise. Today, ALOHA is the fastest-growing bar in the Natural Channel and US Food, a certified B Corp, one of the few climate-neutral brands in its category, and has been recognized as one of Inc.’s fastest-growing private companies. A seasoned leader in the CPG industry, Brad has a track record of driving turnarounds and growth for major health and wellness brands. As SVP/GM, he led the revival of Nature’s Bounty, consulted for KIND Snacks, and held key roles at Chobani, Under Armour, and Frito-Lay.&quot;,
