      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Sam Hatch, known online as DuckyTheGamer and Quacks (on his Roblox channel QuacksBlox), is an American content creator, YouTuber, and Twitch streamer. He launched his YouTube career at age 11, starting with Minecraft mobile content before finding early success with Madden Mobile tutorials. His breakthrough came with Fortnite Mobile, where he became one of the most recognized competitive mobile players, earning six figures in tournament winnings. A self-described \&quot;professional iPad Kid,\&quot; Sam dropped out of his engineering program just four months into college to pursue content full-time, building his main channel DuckyTheGamer to nearly 1 million subscribers while expanding into Roblox content through his second channel QuacksBlox. His content philosophy centers on authenticity: creating videos he would want to watch himself, which has helped him build a loyal following allowing him to tap into the massive Gen Z and Gen Alpha audience that dominates the platform.&quot;,
