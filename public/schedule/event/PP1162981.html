  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As AI rapidly reshapes education and work, HBCUs sit at a critical intersection of talent development, cultural stewardship, and community accountability. This panel brings together higher education, industry, and ecosystem leaders to examine how ethical AI pathways can be built with HBCUs—not around them. Panelists will explore practical models for aligning curriculum, workforce pipelines, industry partnerships, and community impact so AI innovation leads to access, ownership, and long-term opportunity for Black talent and communities.</p>
