  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Ryley Hall is a multi-talented musician, singer, and actor. She was born in Covington, Louisiana and raised in San Antonio, Texas. She began her music career in elementary school, performing in choir and school plays. During her years in high school, she began writing original music with Chelsea Guy and together they wrote her debut album Moments. On her sixteenth birthday, she was gifted a guitar by her grandmother and began playing acoustic shows locally. 
Ryley graduated from the University of Incarnate Word in May of 2025, where she majored in Music Industry Studies.  She recently released her single, &quot;F U&quot; in February 2026.
Ryley&#39;s love for music stems from the joy and escape it gives to the listener. She feels that when we listen to music we are all equal, because music touches us at our core and brings out emotions we have all experienced in our lives. She is equally passionate about acting and voice over work, and is actively pursuing these careers along with her music. Regardless of the form it takes, Ryley dreams of building her career in the arts. Her goals include becoming a full-time entertainer and touring the world.</p>
