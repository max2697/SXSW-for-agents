  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>If an artwork is to be ours, it must be a product of our own vision. AI assistants are readily available. But how do we make sure we never give away so much to a virtual assistant that nothing we create feels like it is authentically ours anymore? How can we keep the joy, the purpose, and the power of our making while engaging AI to support the project of our work coming into being? This workshop will offer a series of core principles, plus meditation and journaling practices, designed to help participants intuit which parts of their project to do themselves and which to outsource.</p>

Her work has been included in the Best American Poetry anthology, and she’s given poetry readings at the Getty Museum, MOCA, and Cambridge University. She’s been interviewed on BBC Radio and has been profiled in the magazines Flaunt, Issue and Malibu. In addition to writing books, she makes performance-based works that combine poetry with musical technique; those works are the subject of the feature-length documentary Peace Piece: The Immersive Poems of Mandy Kahn.\n\nKahn has long worked at the intersection of poetry and technology. In 2018, she wrote a script-in-verse for a VR film being developed by Annapurna Pictures and Oculus Story Studio’s co-founder, Saschka Unseld.
