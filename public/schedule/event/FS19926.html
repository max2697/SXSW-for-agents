      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Alex Prager is a director, screenwriter and artist based in Los Angeles. Prager won an Emmy in 2012 for her short film series, “Touch of Evil” (2011) commissioned by the New York Times. She has made over 10 short films that include “Despair” (2010) with Bryce Dallas Howard, “Face In The Crowd” (2013) with Elizabeth Banks, “Play the Wind” (2019) with Riley Keough and “Uncanny Valley” (2018) with Cate Blanchett. Her short film “Despair” was included in the “New Photography 2010” exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. Her most recent short film, “Run” with Katherine Waterston (2022), premiered at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and was nominated for the 2023 SXSW Grand Jury Award. In 2023, Prager was named one of the 25 New Faces of Independent Film by Filmmaker Magazine.\n\nPrager began her career as an artist and is known for large-scale photographic works that distort the boundaries between reality and artifice, often centered around the human condition. She has been featured in countless galleries and museum exhibitions globally over two decades and her work is held in many international public and private collections. \n\nShe has defined her signature style through photography, short films and now narrative features. DreamQuil, co-written with her sister Vanessa Prager, is her directorial debut.\n\nPart director, part screenwriter, part artist, part time-traveler from a sunnier, stranger version of Los Angeles.&quot;,
