  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>History&#39;s biggest technology waves, from electrification to the internet, were convergence stories, derived not from single inventions but a combination of them. Today, that pattern repeats where AI, robotics, advanced materials, bioengineering, and energy systems are producing solutions that no single discipline, company, or lab could create alone. Based on the World Economic Forum&#39;s Technology Convergence Report, this session unveils the 3C Framework - Combination, Convergence, Compounding - analyzing 246 technologies across 8 advanced technology domains, spotlighting pioneers excelling from this wave of fusion plays. See how convergence unlocks new opportunities and learn to spot, and activate, the next wave before it breaks.</p>
