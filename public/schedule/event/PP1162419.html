  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The need to compete is deeply ingrained in every aspect of our lives and work. It’s often viewed as a positive: we are told it motivates us to do our best, to work hard, that it drives innovation and excellence. But, what if that’s a lie? In this session, Ruchika T. Malhotra, in conversation with author, speaker and HBR editor Amy Gallo, offers a new framework for flourishing at work and in life, by highlighting five key principles to mythbust what we&#39;ve been taught about competition, rewrite the rules, and build cultures of collaboration, solidarity, and mutuality—that lift everyone up.</p>
