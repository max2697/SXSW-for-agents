  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Truth is harder to pin down than ever. This session explores how algorithms, AI, platform design, and evolving media ecosystems are reshaping how people understand what’s real. As trust in information sources shifts, we’ll look at how public belief is formed, how it can be influenced, and what that means for the future of shared reality. The conversation will offer practical insight into how creators, technologists, and communicators can help rebuild trust in an age of information overload. In conversation with Imran Ahmed, the session will feature a leading, award-winning journalist known for shaping national conversations on truth, media, and influence.</p>
