      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Stephanie is co-founder and CEO of Third State Books, the first general-interest publishing house dedicated exclusively to AAPI authors and stories. She previously spent fifteen years in digital marketing and operations, first as a strategist for advertising clients at Google, then leading e-commerce teams and managing multi-million-dollar advertising budgets for retail brands such as ModCloth, Bebe, and Serena Williams’s eponymous fashion label. Early in her career, she sifted through slush piles as an intern at Penguin Putnam and edited a mathematical children’s book for Charlesbridge Publishing, so her work at Third State Books feels truly like coming full circle.  Stephanie lives in San Francisco with her family.&quot;,

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Thien Ho was elected District Attorney of Sacramento County in 2022, and officially took office in January 2023. Prior to the election, Thien served in executive management as the Sacramento County Assistant Chief Deputy D.A. over the Justice and Community Relations Bureau, which handles post-conviction litigation, training, community prosecution and media outreach.\r\rOver Thien’s 25-year career as an attorney, he successfully prosecuted sexual assault, gang and homicide cases. He was the supervisor of the Gang and Hate Crime Unit and has personally charged and prosecuted hate crimes. Most notably, he successfully prosecuted the East Area Rapist/Golden State Killer, who committed 13 murders and over 50 sexual assaults in 11 different jurisdictions throughout California. Michelle McNamara wrote about the case in her book, “I’ll be Gone in the Dark.” The case has also been featured on CNN, HBO, 20/20 and countless news outlets across the world. In November 2025, DA Ho published his first true crime memoir, The People vs. the Golden State Killer, chronicling his journey from a Vietnamese refugee to the lead prosecutor in the landmark case against serial killer and rapist Joseph DeAngelo.&quot;,
