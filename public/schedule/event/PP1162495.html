  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Iconic worlds are being reimagined across XR and shared-reality formats, giving audiences new ways to step inside the stories they love. Bringing together leaders from Meta, NBCUniversal, Nexus Studios and Cosm, we’ll explore how spatial storytelling is evolving as major IP moves into these new environments – and what’s ahead as these mediums step from the bleeding-edge into the mainstream. The panel will unpack what audiences are responding to, how scalable business models are emerging across platforms, and the new creative opportunities this opens up for worldbuilders.</p>
