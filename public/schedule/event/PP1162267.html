  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Want to get your music placed in TV, film, or games? 

Hear directly from top music supervisors on how they discover music, what makes a great pitch, and why some tracks get skipped. 

We’ll break down how artists can build trust, when to reach out, and how sync agents help. 

This is a candid conversation for music creators serious about sync and a continuation from the SXSW experiences I brought in 2025 — with real advice from the people who make the placements happen.</p>
