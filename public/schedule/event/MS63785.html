  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Lola Bates is not your traditional singer songwriter. Raised in the hills of Laurel Canyon, her musical roots connect deeply to nature, vinyl, and the historic lady of the canyon, Joni Mitchell, as well as other female rock and pop icons Kate Bush, Tori Amos and PJ Harvey. Bates is a classically trained pianist, multi-instrumentalist, composer, producer who weaves lush vocal harmonies through pop, rock, and folk styles in her original songs, all showcased on her upcoming debut LP, &#39;Love and Power.&#39; The LP is set for release in spring of 2026, on Gravel and Echo Recordings, distributed by Virgin Music Group. Bates’ elegant vocal arrangements, cinematic songwriting and multi-instrumental prowess sparks the ears of engaged music lovers, lyrically following the journey of a woman exploring her inner power and strength to take agency of life, love and relationships. Recorded and produced in her Laurel Canyon studio, ‘Love and Power’ is a manifestation of Lola’s depth as a composer and producer, making this a fully realized 10-song album, in collaboration with co-producer Maxwell Joseph, Grammy award winning engineer, Robert Carranza, and executive producer Tyler Bates.</p>
