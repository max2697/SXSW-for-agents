  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Qual “testing” in Creative has a bad reputation, but that’s because the way most of it is framed and conducted is shit. It relies on likes and dislikes, dampening the soul of the work - making Creative vanilla. But not in our world. Here, winning Creative comes when brilliant brains are inspired by Qual; we elevate Creative by exploring unknown unknowns and using Creative to stimulate - and to power stronger ideas. Qual is no threat to creativity, it’s a catalyst.

We’ll prove that research is invaluable and deliver a Creative Power Playbook, co-created with
Creatives, CMOs and Insight Directors from the biggest brands to supercharge your work so it really lands in an age when your work has to hit harder than ever.</p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Joe’s done strategy everywhere that matters - BBH, Mother, and now at Quality Meats Creative, one of Ad Age’s best agencies. Brand, comms, design, creative - he’s covered it. Director titles, head of this, head of that. But the real headline? Joe moves fast, thinks sharp, and actually gets things done. He’s written ads, built econometric models, and somehow racked up 40,000+ LinkedIn followers without ever sounding like a LinkedIn guy. A generalist by design, a doer by instinct. On stage, he’s everything strategy talks usually aren’t: quick, clear, human, and actually interesting. No jargon. No theatre. Just proper ideas, built for the real world.&quot;,
