  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Across homes, offices, and classrooms, AI is becoming ubiquitous—mapping our routes, writing our code, even dreaming up art in seconds. What once sounded like science fiction is now silently transforming our daily existence. And yet, amid this great digital leap forward, a quieter, more fragile system is at stake: the human brain.
We are perched at a precipice in history. As AI systems grow in power and presence, we must ask a question too few dare to voice: What is this doing to us - our capacity to explore, to learn, to reason, and to create? The machines are learning. But are we forgetting?</p>
