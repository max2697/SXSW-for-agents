  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Gus Baldwin is a singer/songwriter/ex-hippie/part-time punk from Austin, TX. After a stint holding down drums for Dallas surf punks Sealion in high school, Baldwin went on to form the Psych Pop combo Acid Carousel, which he led for 6 years and 20 something releases before departing the band. Moving to Austin, Baldwin started quickly self releasing a string of singles and EPs on his own GetWithIt! Imprint and establishing himself as the godson of Texas Rock n Roll. Teaming up with former bandmates and friends Gus formed The Sketch in 2022. Embracing the aggression of dirty punk, the looseness of garage, and the charm of power pop, The Sketch established themselves as new cornerstones of the Austin rock scene. Recording their debut LP with the group in one day of recording in LA in the spring of 2024, “The Sketch” is the culmination of Baldwin’s vision, manifested through the power of The Sketch themselves. In late 2025, Baldwin released his first full length solo LP. With the selt-titled debut, Gus focuses in on his rock n&#39; roll stylings, while at the same time showing great versatility as a songwriter. Not being afraid to mix opposite loves of Punk and Pop into one cohesive album.</p>
