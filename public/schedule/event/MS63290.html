  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Lew Apollo is a rising force in modern soul, captivating audiences with his soul-stirring melodies and poignant songwriting. KUTX praised him as “the perfect summer vibe,” a fitting description for an artist whose music blends hypnotic guitar, cinematic production, and a sultry, smoky voice into lush, resonant soundscapes. Originally hailing from rural Barnum, MN, Lew’s artistry is deeply rooted in his home state’s heritage, fusing the legacies of Bob Dylan and Prince with modern influences like Hozier, Leon Bridges, and Labrinth.
The tragic loss of his father in 2022 profoundly shaped Lew’s songwriting, catalyzing a body of work that confronts themes of grief, isolation, and resilience while offering hope and connection. His debut EP JUNGLE, produced by BLK ODYSSY, introduced him as a bold new voice and fueled a run of sold-out shows at iconic Austin venues like The Pershing and Antone’s.
Since then, Lew has taken his music to wider audiences, touring in support of Los Lonely Boys and earning airplay on KUTX with his single “Diamonds and Gold” as well as “Let the Light In” from his debut album. Self-produced from start to finish, Fool’s Gold has already surpassed 300,000 streams in under two months and is creating buzz for its fearless vulnerability and lush production. Press outlets have echoed the excitement: AMP Music declared “Lew Apollo will be a force in the R&amp;B and pop stratospheres. Be warned,” while Earmilk praised how “Apollo’s signature smoky voice sets the tone for a sultry soundscape.” With his clear vision and unwavering dedication to using music as a vessel for healing, Lew Apollo is quickly emerging as one of the most exciting new voices to watch in soul.</p>
