  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Fusion energy could transform civilization or remain perpetually out of reach. Some say commercially viable fusion is decades and billions of dollars away, one of the hardest problems humanity will solve. Others claim it&#39;s coming by 2028. Which is it? The gap between these predictions comes down to what “viable” means and which technical barriers matter most. This panel tackles the friction head-on with grounded discussion on fusion milestones, market economics, and fusion&#39;s role in powering AI and energy infrastructure. Expect hard questions and competing perspectives from people building and tracking the technology.</p>
