      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Jessica M. Thompson is an Emmy-nominated filmmaker whose feature writing-directing debut, \&quot;The Light of the Moon\&quot;, premiered in-competition at SXSW and won the Audience Award for Best Narrative Film. The film enjoyed a limited theatrical release to sold-out screens and heralds a 97% Rotten Tomatoes score. Critics called the film \&quot;harrowingly effective\&quot; (Variety), \&quot;honest and complex\&quot; (The Hollywood Reporter), and stated that \&quot;for any filmmaker, this would be an unmitigated triumph, but for a first-time filmmaker this is revelatory.\&quot;\n\nJess was the lead director on the Showtime/Sky limited series \&quot;The End\&quot;, produced by the Oscar-winning See-Saw Films (The Power of the Dog, The King&#39;s Speech). The series received five-star reviews from The Times &amp;amp; The Guardian.\n\nHer second directorial feature \&quot;The Invitation\&quot;, a Sony Pictures gothic-thriller, had its worldwide theatrical release in August 2022. It opened #1 at the box office and later reached #2 on Netflix, with over 664 million minutes streamed in its opening weekend.\n\nJess founded Stedfast Productions in 2010.&quot;,
