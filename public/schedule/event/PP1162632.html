  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Touch, breath, viscera, pulsing sound - XR can be much more than a trick of the eye. Meet 4 artists developing revolutionary work supported by the UK’s Immersive Arts.

Hear about their groundbreaking work that connects our bodies and senses; a multiplayer VR work redefining menopause (The Baby Factory is Closed); a multisensory dancefloor foregrounding access (Beat Blocks); explore breath as a symbiotic force fusing VR, networked performance, and biosensitive technologies (Breathscapes); and a hands on interactive sci-fi work exploring queer &amp; post-human ecologies (Hermaphrogenesis). </p>

      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Clémentine Bedos is a transmedia artist, researcher, and educator whose work bridges embodied research, community building, and extended-reality technologies. Drawing from a multicultural heritage and an interdisciplinary background in law, philosophy, and fine arts, their practice explores the entanglements of mind, body, and consciousness within hegemonic systems of identity.\n\nThrough site-sensitive installations and performances, Bedos brings ancestral, diasporic, and esoteric knowledge systems into dialogue with XR, disrupting colonial and ableist logics embedded in emerging technologies. Their work reorients aesthetic focus inward, reclaiming the body—its sensuality, and inner visuality—as sites of emancipation, relationality, and non-duality.&quot;,

Having completed Marina Abramovic&#39;s &#39;Cleaning the House&#39; training in durational performance, their work delves into themes of embodiment and posthumanism, investigating how speculative narratives can reimagine the body as a site of transformation and potential. In 2024 Marcin graduated MA in Virtual and Expanded Realities from the University of the West of England and is a resident of Pervasive Media Studio for Creative Technologies in Bristol, UK.\n\nThey have presented their work internationally, including at the Sheffield DocFest, VSSL Studio, CPH:DOX, Terytoria Festiwal, and Modern Art Oxford.&quot;,
