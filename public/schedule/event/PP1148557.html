  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>You’ve seen the viral humanoid demos—now meet the people actually shipping them. From hospitals to warehouses, humanoid robots are already on shift. They ride elevators, open doors, and work alongside people in busy environments. But making that leap from prototype to real-world, reliable performance? It’s hard. This panel brings together renowned founders and researchers who’ve built and deployed some of the first real humanoids at scale. Join us for a behind-the-scenes conversation about what&#39;s working, what’s not, and what it really takes to get robots out of the lab and into the world.</p>
