  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Taking over the sweaty New York venues and curbside congregations that came to be
synonymous with the name, Bloodsports is set to release their long awaited debut LP Anything
Can Be A Hammer via brand new New York label Good English Records on October 17th.
Bloodsports has become an undeniable force amidst their latest line up, where members Sam
Murphy (guitar/vox), Jeremy Mock (Guitar), Liv Eriksen (bass/vox) and Scott Hale (drums) find
solace in the capitulation of sonic strain; where angular sedition blends with economical
melodies that lighten the load of the self-destruction that these songs embrace. But as bold as
their landscapes have been prior, Anything Can Be A Hammer finds the band embracing a more
dynamic approach, maturing in their techniques as these songs brim over with subtle fixations –
balancing a steady pace of experimentation and curiosity that linger amongst the rhythmic blows
and befuddling depths that the band confidently explores. Fragile, yet abundant, Bloodsports
leans into that patience that plays to our own interior designs, where Murphy’s lyricism is a
notion of both what we know and what we think we know, as it all comes to the fore when our
obsessions are at large. It’s an album that’s got blood in its veins and a finger on the pulse.</p>
