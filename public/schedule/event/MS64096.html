  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Jasmine makes swaying, folk-tinged acoustic pop songs with a full voice that teems with rich emotion. Her sonic palette makes sense when she describes the music she was most interested in growing up. “The earliest memories I have are of driving down to see my grandparents, and we listened to different music in the car on my dad’s iPod,” she recalls, “There’d be David Gray, Tracy Chapman, Dido, Gipsy Kings, The Eagles – old songs, classic albums. And I feel like they went into my psyche. I’m obsessed with any kind of acoustic, well-played guitar.”

She also references her love of R&amp;B and a current new love with Fontaines DC (“the first time I heard them they grabbed my heart; if my music does what they and other artists do for me and moves them to feel something, I’d be happy”). There is also mention of the emotional resonance of watching Bollywood films with her Gujarati grandmother back when she was a kid: “In terms of vocals, I do think that’s made a bit of an impact,” she says of those Hindi songs she internalised.</p>
