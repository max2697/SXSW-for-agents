Cardinal Bloom's debut album “The Only Place I’ve Ever Known” released September of 2024 marking a new era of their music while still holding true to the sound they've carved as their own. Cardinal Bloom’s music encapsulates the nostalgic and bittersweet feeling of ‘better days,’ yet leaving you a notion there is still so much life ahead of us to be lived.\n\nCardinal Bloom is currently on tour throughout the U.S. and you can find tickets here on spotify or on their website www.cardinalbloom.com.\n \n“Everything they did worked together to absolutely nail that dusty Deseret sound—one that sits in between pop, rock, and folk.” -Zach Collier (Provo Music Magazine)\n \nTheir members include Joey St. John on guitar and vocals, Jacob Silvester on the bass and vocals, Josh Thomas on guitar, and Nate Adair on drums.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cardinal-bloom/1468351269","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/cardinalbloomofficial?igsh=NGFscDVvdjExMDZ2&utm_source=qr","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/4PEcSbxhg1e5LkLT1dn1nb?si=9XhPh3s5Qpe_jfwWwFoddw","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@cardinalbloomofficial?_t=ZP-8yUs5KebclC&_r=1","twitter":"https://x.com/cardinalbloom?s=21&t=Ho34asdcfAP4-y1d_cgGHw","website":"https://www.cardinalbloom.com","youtube":"https://youtu.be/XkbzQtnkEDo?si=4PCY-v9Bd0fVaauV"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V0230","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Swan

Her solo debut ‘My Year’ spotlit her brand of sparkling pop, before a collaboration with Ebenezer (‘Mulholland Drive’) earned her over 10 million streams. Her subsequent EP ‘Alien’ referenced golden-era pop. That same year, ‘ADCT’ (written when she was 17) soared to the #1 spot on both TikTok Trending Sounds and the UK Top 50, earning over 30 million streams. Morgan also co-wrote and featured on Rudimental & Digga D’s ‘Be the One’, Sigma’s ‘Adrenaline Rush’ and Purple Disco Machine's most recent album.  She’s been writing for some of the biggest K-pop artists (including NCT’s Jaehyun, TWICE & Aespa).\n\nMorgan released her EP ‘Emotional Gangster’ last October and went on to sell out her first UK headline tour at the end of the year including a show at London’s iconic Jazz Cafe.

His profile continues to grow as he brings his sound to live shows, brand events and cultural moments that pull in diverse crowds.

Every verse, every chord, every silence is an invitation to look inward and recognize yourself, always from a place of love.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"FAMA","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"jwpxvajWq1I","related_sales_client":null}

She was selected as an official SXSW Artist for 2025 and has been featured in The Austin Chronicle for her live performances, recognized for their commanding presence and genre-blending sound.\n\nWith

Kobe is a Houston-based Hip-Hop and R&B artist originally from Columbus, Ohio, known for her emotionally resonant lyricism, refined storytelling, and moody, early-2000s-inspired aesthetic.

She was selected as an official SXSW Artist for 2025 and has been featured in The Austin Chronicle for her live performances, recognized for their commanding presence and genre-blending sound.\n\nWith a growing catalog and a distinct visual identity, Anaya Kobe continues to carve out her own lane — poised, emotionally compelling, and unmistakably her own","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"ANAYA KOBE","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"sZ6CI7OeYSg","related_sales_client":null}

Now Brooklyn-based, she continues to capture listeners with her fiercely vulnerable songwriting and compelling live performances. Wilby’s debut single “Bad” (2020) gained immediate attention, followed by \"Translucent Beauty” (2021), drifting between bedroom pop and indie rock. Her sophomore EP, “Happiest Woman” (2023), marked a shift toward showcasing a full-band production, mirroring the force of Wilby’s live sound. Wilby’s debut album, “Center of Affection” (2025, via Hit the North Records), explores both the cathartic side of indie-rock and the vulnerable side of twangy folk. Wilby has been featured in FLOOD Magazine, Luna Collective, and Ones To Watch, named an Artist to Watch by Atwood Magazine, with support from Seattle’s KEXP and Nashville’s WNXP and Lightning

Maria Crawford has been paving her way through the Nashville independent music scene since 2014. Now Brooklyn-based, she continues to capture listeners with her fiercely vulnerable songwriting and compelling live performances. Wilby’s debut single “Bad” (2020) gained immediate attention, followed by \"Translucent Beauty” (2021), drifting between bedroom pop and indie rock. Her sophomore EP, “Happiest Woman” (2023), marked a shift toward showcasing a full-band production, mirroring the force of Wilby’s live sound. Wilby’s debut album, “Center of Affection” (2025, via Hit the North Records), explores both the cathartic side of indie-rock and the vulnerable side of twangy folk. Wilby has been featured in FLOOD Magazine, Luna Collective, and Ones To Watch, named an Artist to Watch by Atwood Magazine, with support from Seattle’s KEXP and Nashville’s WNXP and Lightning 100.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"WILBY","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"QncLhPd-604","related_sales_client":null}

With an attack that is both relentless and melodic, the all-female band are a genuinely unique proposition - refusing to be pigeon holed, they are here to shake up perceptions with their intelligent, stylish and raucous take on rock music.\n\nCiting influences from Nirvana to Porridge Radio and Idles to boygenius, the band have been developing their dynamic songwriting. The music moves between aggressive and heavy instrumentation and slower, more melodic passages, creating a powerful contrast. They use their voices to create layered harmonies and the result is a unique and expansive sound.\n\nThe band have supported Idles, Big Special, Katy J Pearson and Arxx. They’ve been championed by BBC Introducing and BBC Radio 1 and have had BBC 6 Music support from Steve Lamacq, Emily Pilbeam and Amy Lamé.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/us/song/slaughterhouse/1789201692","bandcamp":"https://grandmashouseband.bandcamp.com/music","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/grandmashouseband/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/grandmashouseband/?hl=en","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/1Xew7ViCqVQbFl2SHfA5St?si=5dfd3bf2cf9d4473","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@grandmashouseband","website":"https://www.grandmashouse.co.uk/","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6AAEIE761Y"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V1168","indoor_outdoor":"OUTDOOR","name":"Low

The music moves between aggressive and heavy instrumentation and slower, more melodic passages, creating a powerful contrast. They use their voices to create layered harmonies and the result is a unique and expansive sound.\n\nThe band have supported Idles, Big Special, Katy J Pearson and Arxx.

For fans of Fontaines D.C., The Beths, IDLES, and Wunderhorse. Their songs are drenched in emotion and exist to make you feel something, they speak of real life, friendship, mental health, profound loss and the beauty of the human experience.\n\nThe band travelled to Canada to record their debut album non-violent with Scott Middleton (Cancer Bats), capturing their intense, unfiltered sound. Known for their high-energy live shows, Haters have performed at Bigsound (Australia), NXNE (Toronto), Sled Island (Calgary), and completed several cross-country Canadian tours.\n\nTheir debut album non-violent was released in March 2025, accompanied by sold-out shows throughout Canada and Australia accompanied by rapid growth across streaming and fan engagement, with listenership led by the US, followed by Canada and Australia, 1000's of playlist adds and major Apple Music and Spotify editorial support.\nWith a fierce commitment to honesty, connection, and powerful performances, Haters continue to build momentum as a force in the indie punk scene.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/au/album/wander-wonder/1762970134?i=1762970136","bandcamp":"https://haters.bandcamp.com/","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/hatersloveyouxo/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/hatersloveyouxo","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/5Jhlti8UHIG6HpcWp24jH8?si=dc158ccef5564b11","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@hatersloveyouxo","website":"https://www.haters.love","youtube":"https://youtu.be/6TxgC3phZcQ?si=PiVUdzsPpgD7Rgkk"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V1168","indoor_outdoor":"OUTDOOR","name":"Low

are an Australian indie punk/garage band formed by Jai Sparks (vocals/guitar), James Priest (drums), and Kaito (Kaitlyn Hold – bass/vocals). For fans of Fontaines D.C., The Beths, IDLES, and Wunderhorse. Their songs are drenched in emotion and exist to make you feel something, they speak of real life, friendship, mental health, profound loss and the beauty of the human experience.\n\nThe band travelled to Canada to record their debut album non-violent with Scott Middleton (Cancer Bats), capturing their intense, unfiltered sound. Known for their high-energy live shows, Haters have performed at Bigsound (Australia), NXNE (Toronto), Sled Island (Calgary), and completed several cross-country Canadian tours.\n\nTheir debut album non-violent was released in March 2025, accompanied by sold-out shows throughout Canada and Australia accompanied by rapid growth across streaming and fan engagement, with listenership led by the US, followed by Canada and Australia, 1000's of playlist adds and major Apple Music and Spotify editorial support.\nWith a fierce commitment to honesty, connection, and powerful performances, Haters continue to build momentum as a force in the indie punk scene.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"HATERS","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"6TxgC3phZcQ","related_sales_client":null}

Born and raised in a small town surrounded by rivers and forests, she began her musical journey at the age of six, training as a classical pianist, before embracing songwriting as her true path.\nInfluenced by her father’s deep love for folk music, Alkyone began experimenting with traditional songs and textures, weaving a distinct folklore thread into her musical identity. Her sound blends indie songwriting, cinematic atmospheres, and folk elements from the Mediterranean and the Balkans. Singing in both English and Greek, her lyrics explore memory, growing up, and our evolving relationship with the world, while her concerts carry an intimate, personal, and emotionally charged atmosphere.\nShe has performed across Europe (Konzerthaus, Tonhalle, Carré, SNF, Onassis Foundation and others). In 2023, she collaborated with Vincent Moon and was featured on La Blogothèque. Her critically acclaimed debut album Exit Sign was released in 2023, while her second studio album, Small Philosophies, is expected in late spring 2026.\nHer stage name, Alkyone, is a tribute to a recurring dream in which she was a bird.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/gr/album/genesis-single/1657486004","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/alkyonemusic/?hl=el","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/album/1UZWqopfuqAxRZ09sczjwP?si=HRSnPNsOTyWi_jOJlvGr6g","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@alkyone_music","youtube":"https://youtu.be/Gh8kDk7JA2A?si=hjhhls8sAZLhB4Zs"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V1683","indoor_outdoor":"OUTDOOR","name":"Augustine","parent_id":null,"parent_venue_name":null,"venue_entry_info":null,"formats":null,"location":{"address":"86

In September she released the labyrinthine “Buckshot” to critical acclaim.\n\nFrom her home in Springfield, Missouri, willoh records and creates music, having first found her footing on Garageband

native willoh is riding the crest of a wave of excitement over her new series of singles leading up to her spring 2026 album release.  On her latest track, EARMILK writes ““OUCHIE” defies easy categorization, blending synth-pop, raw punk attitude, and alt-rock vibes into a shifting, avant-garde sound.”  \n\n\nWilloh’s self-produced 20205  debut, not more than that, but more please presents us with a raw honesty rendered through snowy vocals that sit in rarefied air and belies the artist’s 19 years. In September she released the labyrinthine “Buckshot” to critical acclaim.\n\nFrom her home in Springfield, Missouri, willoh records and creates music, having first found her footing on Garageband before graduating to LogicPro–making the upgrade from her earnings working many long shifts at McDonalds.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"WILLOH","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"2jL_4FtXo1c","related_sales_client":null}

In her songwriting and performance, she combines the grit and attitude of the alt-rock of her hometown—where she often retreats to write—with a sleeker, more transatlantic aesthetic. Aided by producers Chris Coady (Beach House, TV On the Radio, The Kills) and Sam Westhoff, the songs on the EP blend rock ’n’ roll edge with synth gestures reminiscent of ’80s dream pop. Akira’s smoky vocals feel intimate and otherworldly at the same time, mirroring the moments in her songs when the real and the imagined seem to fold together and become inextricable.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Akira hopes her songs will connect with people who have gone through experiences similar to hers and effectively describe inner states that feel difficult to articulate—for instance, the desire for complete knowledge of another person. In the most powerful moments on What’s Inside You, she writes about our strange proclivities in love without judgment. These indelible songs capture emotional truth—the bold handiwork of an artist who prizes depth and substance in addition to her adventurous

SXSW Community Service Awards celebrate leaders and non-profit organizations from Austin and around the world who work tirelessly to improve the standing of the specific groups and causes that they serve.\r\rTaylor McGraw is a journalist and educator dedicated to giving young people the tools to tell their own stories. Prior to co-founding The Bell in 2017, he spent five years teaching and coaching in New York City schools, where he recognized that the voices most impacted by education policy were the ones least involved in shaping it.\r\rUnder his leadership, The Bell has grown from a podcast project into a nationally recognized leader in youth-led journalism. The organization’s student reporting has shifted from the classroom to the halls of power: its coverage of school segregation and inequity has been cited in citywide policy discussions and featured on national airwaves. The Bell’s student reporters have twice been named finalists for the National Awards for Education Reporting, competing against professional newsrooms of all sizes.\r\rBeyond producing impactful youth-led storytelling, Taylor is a driving force for systemic change in journalism education. In 2022, he spearheaded the formation of the NYC Youth Journalism Coalition, a collective effort to strengthen the journalism career pipeline. Through the Coalition's \"\"Journalism for All\"\" initiative, The Bell and partners are actively expanding journalism programs to dozens of schools that historically lacked them, democratizing access to the field for thousands of students.\r\rNow based in Jackson, Mississippi, Taylor is scaling The Bell's work through the Jackson Youth Newsroom, a program focused on building a new generation of civic-minded journalists in the Deep South.\r\rTaylor holds an MFA in Creative Writing from The New School, an MA in Teaching from Relay GSE, and a BA in Public Policy Leadership from the University of Mississippi. His love for journalism began at his own high school newspaper in Oxford, Mississippi, and he remains committed to ensuring that every student has a platform to speak truth to power.\r","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"SXSW COMMUNITY SERVICE AWARDS RECOGNITION: THE BELL","source":"Affiliate","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":null,"related_sales_client":null}

Winn is the Excellence in Learning Graduate School of Education Professor and Faculty Director of the Stanford Accelerator for Learning's Equity in Learning Initiative.

With over 30 years of experience across high-tech and life sciences, Tony has worked in organizations where innovation, pressure, and uncertainty collide. Along the way, he discovered a truth that now defines his work: brilliance doesn’t disappear in organizations; it goes dormant when people are asked to fragment themselves to perform.\nThrough his company, Inspired Purpose Partners, Tony designs transformational experiences that unlock what he calls multidimensional leadership: the ability to integrate purpose, presence, creativity, and connection while making a meaningful impact. His work helps leaders gain clarity, make better decisions, and lead in ways that are both human and sustainable.\nTony is the best-selling author of Climbing the Right Mountain and Campfire Lessons for Leaders, the host of The Virtual Campfire Podcast, and a sought-after global keynote speaker. He is known for creating spaces, often described as “campfires,” where people can speak honestly, think expansively, and reconnect with who they are becoming. His work blends proven leadership frameworks with storytelling, design thinking, and deep relational practice to turn insight into action.","links":{},"type":"person"}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":null,"floor":null,"id":"V2449","indoor_outdoor":null,"name":"Next Stage (Manchester

A former professional ballerina turned civil engineer, entrepreneur, and nonprofit founder, her journey embodies the power of reinvention—and how creativity, when embraced across every field of life, can be profoundly transformative.\n\nAfter performing with Houston Ballet II and Ballet Florida, Andrea earned degrees from Florida Atlantic University and Cornell University, transitioning from the stage to the built environment. She went on to launch her own firm, Virgin Design, where she infused human-centered creativity into land development. Once an anomaly for bridging the arts and engineering, she became determined to make creativity the rule in a future that demands more imagination, not less.\n\nThat mission inspired her founding of The Center, where she serves as Chair &amp; CEO. Under her leadership, The Center has raised nearly $25 million, engaged Pritzker Prize-winning Renzo Piano Building Workshop, and positioned itself to redefine creativity and its role in society for the 21st century.\n\nA sought-after speaker on creativity, resilience, and technology, Andrea has been featured at CreativeMornings, BitBasel, Leading Between the Lines, Launching Simplified, and Quantum Beach 2025. Her work has been recognized by Palm Beach Illustrated’s Women On Top, The Palm Beach 100, and Boca Magazine’s Fantastic Four.\n\nWhen she’s not leading transformative initiatives, Andrea finds creative renewal with her daughters and husband—or on the ballroom dance floor at Fred Astaire Dance Studio in Boca Raton.","links":{},"type":"person"}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":null,"floor":"4","id":"V0376","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Salon D","parent_id":"V0365","parent_venue_name":"Hilton

relevance. In a widely successful experimental pilot, Hot Topic has launched two social-first sitcoms shot entirely in malls, casting creators from punk, goth, and cosplay scenes to reclaim its ALT roots.

Doctor is a vérité non-fiction film following three prominent physicians–Palestinian, Jewish and Zoroastrian—friends who couldn’t be more different but are bound by the shared oath to heal.

Filmed in unfolding, on-the-ground scenes, the story follows them from a Gazan hospital under siege, to the halls of Congress.

the Dominican town of Cabarete, bachata is a way of life far from the dance halls that it occupies overseas.

Gillespie is the daughter of a cable splicer and a seamstress. As a filmmaker, she is preoccupied with character-driven explorations of underdogs and outsiders.

She also created, directed, and executive produced Viceland’s highly rated first foray into serialized true crime, \"The Devil You Know.\"\n\nIn addition to directing, Patricia also produces. Her credits include the Emmy-nominated, Oscar-shortlisted Sundance hit \"Unrest\"; Peabody-nominated \"Whose Streets?\"; and Oscar-nominated Robert Stone’s \"Taken Hostage.\" \n\nShe is a proud resident of NYC’s best borough, Queens, where she lives with her dog, Hank, and her husband, Alvaro.","links":{},"type":"person"}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":null,"floor":null,"id":"V0550","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Alamo Lamar 6","parent_id":"V0549","parent_venue_name":"Alamo Lamar","venue_entry_info":null,"formats":null,"location":{"address":"1120 S Lamar Blvd.","lat_lon":[30.2561977,-97.7635717],"city":"Austin","postal_code":"78704","state":"TX","name":"Alamo Lamar"},"root":{"accessible":null,"age_policy":"All Ages","floor":null,"id":"V0549","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Alamo Lamar","parent_id":null,"parent_venue_name":null,"venue_entry_info":null,"formats":null},"events":[{"id":"FS19388","track":"Visions","focus_area":null,"category":"Narrative Feature","event_id":"FS19388","event_type":"screening","format":"Narrative Feature","genre":"Horror","subgenre":"Gaming","name":"Dead Eyes","presented_by":null,"publish_at":"2026-02-04T14:00:00.000-06:00","reservable":true,"reservable_id":"FS19388","reserved":false,"date":"2026-03-12","end_time":"2026-03-12T16:21:00.000-05:00","start_time":"2026-03-12T15:00:00.000-05:00","message":null,"image":{"alt_text":"Dead Eyes","credit":"Dir: Richard E.

A classically trained pianist and vocalist, De Casper commands the stage with a sharpened, unmistakable intensity — trading in the avant-garde gowns and stilettos of the past for a bold, more masculine and unfiltered presence that puts the focus squarely on the music, the message, and the electricity of performance. His 2022 debut LP Femme Boy expanded his sonic world, weaving dancefloor heat, cinematic drama, and queer storytelling into a record that was equal parts brooding and explosive. That same year, the City of Austin proclaimed Caleb De Casper Day, recognizing his cultural impact. He went on to perform yearly at SXSW, Austin City Limits Music Festival, Utopia Fest, Houston’s Art Car Festival, Thin Line Fest,  and multiple Pride celebrations, while continuously advocating for LGBTQIA rights at the Texas State Capitol and beyond. Now, with his forthcoming sophomore album Delirium, De Casper enters a new creative chapter — darker, dirtier, dance-driven, and poised for a breakthrough.","links":{"bandcamp":"https://calebdecasper.bandcamp.com/music","facebook":"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=channel_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbVFKOXJSaThYRDRGakFFeGRjTjh2NWJpblNYd3xBQ3Jtc0tuNDVpZnZFdExNTHBNNThEbC1QekpqWkhvcHdvLUNJTTBwTXJvUFlpM21yVGJUbmNWVjlDUWFoeFFYNzFQSFppbTR4NUhXbnBSZllJQWVWSE1ZbVUxSG9OR0dnWDV1NndKWTZydk9mVFpwemcyeGpCVQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FCaleb.de.Casper%3Fref%3Dhl","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/calebdecasper?igsh=MTN4YmQ2amE3eGVheQ%3D%3D","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/caleb-de-casper","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/67bR5Yok4Md9bRFiUbUDSY?si=4edc96da0dab4e3b","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@calebdecasper?ug_source=op.auth&ug_term=Linktr.ee&utm_source=awyc6vc625ejxp86&utm_campaign=tt4d_profile_link&_r=1","website":"https://www.calebdecasper.com","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE67b7edJiY"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V0248","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Valhalla","parent_id":null,"parent_venue_name":null,"venue_entry_info":null,"formats":null,"location":{"address":"710

the horror cabaret and glam-rock theatrics of his early career to the shadowy, neon-lit world of his current dark synth-pop, Austin-based performer Caleb De Casper has never stopped evolving. A classically trained pianist and vocalist, De Casper commands the stage with a sharpened, unmistakable intensity — trading in the avant-garde gowns and stilettos of the past for a bold, more masculine and unfiltered presence that puts the focus squarely on the music, the message, and the electricity of performance. His 2022 debut LP Femme Boy expanded his sonic world, weaving dancefloor heat, cinematic drama, and queer storytelling into a record that was equal parts brooding and explosive. That same year, the City of Austin proclaimed Caleb De Casper Day, recognizing his cultural impact. He went on to perform yearly at SXSW, Austin City Limits Music Festival, Utopia Fest, Houston’s Art Car Festival, Thin Line Fest,  and multiple Pride celebrations, while continuously advocating for LGBTQIA rights at the Texas State Capitol and beyond. Now, with his forthcoming sophomore album Delirium, De Casper enters a new creative chapter — darker, dirtier, dance-driven, and poised for a breakthrough.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"CALEB DE CASPER","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"uE67b7edJiY","related_sales_client":null}

Her effortless, unmistakable voice delivers songs that are both deeply personal and irresistibly catchy. After featuring on Nurko & Last Heroes’ “Promise Me,” Chambers broke through with singles like “Guess U Suck” (850K+ streams) and “Fever Dream,” which landed on Spotify’s Fresh Finds Pop.\nIn 2025, she was featured on Algorhythm by Los Wizzards, a project nominated for a 2026 Grammy Award, marking a career milestone and highlighting her versatility as an artist and collaborator. Her music will also be featured in the upcoming short film Lake St. Claire, written & directed by Caitlin Meyernik, expanding her work into film and visual storytelling.\nHer single “Fall Right Back” made waves across streaming and social media and was highlighted by Women in Music as one of their Top Songs of 2025. Chambers’ performances have taken her from The Troubadour to Revolution Live, opening for Saint Motel, appearing in respected showcases nationwide, and making her SXSW debut this year. With new music on the way, Jessie Chambers continues to carve a singular path through today’s indie-pop landscape.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/fall-right-back/1818038031?i=1818038036","bandcamp":"https://jessiechambers.bandcamp.com/music","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/share/1APGxhCgj8/?mibextid=wwXIfr","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/jessiechambers/","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/2GhBTOFbf7wiaaMdFjWVnd?si=f0f3f2fe01ac4b80","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@chambersjessiechambers","website":"https://www.jessiechambersmusic.com","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izWTbd6Mf4Y"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V1464","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Las

After featuring on Nurko & Last Heroes’ “Promise Me,” Chambers broke through with singles like “Guess U Suck” (850K+ streams) and “Fever Dream,” which landed on Spotify’s Fresh Finds Pop.\nIn 2025, she was featured on Algorhythm by Los Wizzards, a project nominated for a 2026 Grammy Award, marking a career milestone and highlighting her versatility as an artist and collaborator. Her music will also be featured in the upcoming short film Lake St. Claire, written & directed by Caitlin Meyernik, expanding her work into film and visual storytelling.\nHer single “Fall Right Back” made waves across streaming and social media and was highlighted by Women in Music as one of their Top Songs of 2025. Chambers’ performances have taken her from The Troubadour to Revolution Live, opening for Saint Motel, appearing in respected showcases nationwide, and making her SXSW debut this year. With new music on the way, Jessie Chambers continues to carve a singular path through today’s indie-pop landscape.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"JESSIE CHAMBERS","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"izWTbd6Mf4Y","related_sales_client":null}

Citing Amy Winehouse and Frank Ocean as two key musical influences, Saint has been covered by Rolling Stone, British Vogue, Wonderland, etc. and was named Apple Music's global Up Next artist.

Saint Harison is a rising artist with an undeniable voice from Southampton, United Kingdom. He currently lives in Los Angeles, CA. Having quickly risen to Internet fame from public support from SZA and Jazmine Sullivan to Justin Bieber, Timbaland and Elton John, he’s one of the latest artists to watch. Citing Amy Winehouse and Frank Ocean as two key musical influences, Saint has been covered by Rolling Stone, British Vogue, Wonderland, etc. and was named Apple Music's global Up Next artist. He made his late night TV debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live! after his viral COLORS performance of “ego talkin,” which sparked the viral #egotalkinchallenge on TikTok. His 7-track EP lost a friend was released in 2023 and has amassed over 200M cumulative streams, continuing to grow. He returned in fall 2025 with his single \"ghosted,\" and recently released his latest single \"bad,\" produced by Grammy-winning producer duo NovaWav (Beyoncé, JAY-Z, Jazmine Sullivan, etc.). He's gearing up to release his highly anticipated project this year.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"SAINT HARISON","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"I74e2i_9d6E","related_sales_client":null}

Starting in early 2022, our lead singer moved from Mexico to the UK. The band formed after an impromptu rehearsal session and discovering the chemistry we had playing together we quickly got to work. Writing, playing gigs and recording, releasing our first single in that same year, shortly followed by our debut EP Lonesome Joy. We are now about to release our debut Album with the first few singles already out and their music videos on YouTube hitting almost half a million views. \nHailing from Mexico, Giselle brought to the UK her unique taste and a talent for writing folk pop, looking to explore a new musical direction fuelled by a passion for rock. Finding Cameron and Charlie, two British born and raised musicians marked the inception of I See Orange, mixing multiple genres into their unique post-grunge sound, a deliberate combo of captivating melodies, clever lyricism and heavy rock.\nBringing raw energy, heavy riffs and powerful melodic vocals to every stage we hit. We blend the gritty, nostalgic sound of the 90's with our own unique

are a Mexican lead British 3-piece alternative post-grunge rock band. Starting in early 2022, our lead singer moved from Mexico to the UK. The band formed after an impromptu rehearsal session and discovering the chemistry we had playing together we quickly got to work. Writing, playing gigs and recording, releasing our first single in that same year, shortly followed by our debut EP Lonesome Joy. We are now about to release our debut Album with the first few singles already out and their music videos on YouTube hitting almost half a million views. \nHailing from Mexico, Giselle brought to the UK her unique taste and a talent for writing folk pop, looking to explore a new musical direction fuelled by a passion for rock. Finding Cameron and Charlie, two British born and raised musicians marked the inception of I See Orange, mixing multiple genres into their unique post-grunge sound, a deliberate combo of captivating melodies, clever lyricism and heavy rock.\nBringing raw energy, heavy riffs and powerful melodic vocals to every stage we hit. We blend the gritty, nostalgic sound of the 90's with our own unique twist.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"I SEE ORANGE","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"SZXY7Wtre3Q","related_sales_client":null}

KUTX praised him as “the perfect summer vibe,” a fitting description for an artist whose music blends hypnotic guitar, cinematic production, and a sultry, smoky voice into lush, resonant soundscapes. Originally hailing from rural Barnum, MN, Lew’s artistry is deeply rooted in his home state’s heritage, fusing the legacies of Bob Dylan and Prince with modern influences like Hozier, Leon Bridges, and Labrinth.\nThe tragic loss of his father in 2022 profoundly shaped Lew’s songwriting, catalyzing a body of work that confronts themes of grief, isolation, and resilience while offering hope and connection. His debut EP JUNGLE, produced by BLK ODYSSY, introduced him as a bold new voice and fueled a run of sold-out shows at iconic Austin venues like The Pershing and Antone’s.\nSince then, Lew has taken his music to wider audiences, touring in support of Los Lonely Boys and earning airplay on KUTX with his single “Diamonds and Gold” as well as “Let the Light In” from his debut album. Self-produced from start to finish, Fool’s Gold has already surpassed 300,000 streams in under two months and is creating buzz for its fearless vulnerability and lush production. Press outlets have echoed the excitement: AMP Music declared “Lew Apollo will be a force in the R&B and pop stratospheres. Be warned,” while Earmilk praised how “Apollo’s signature smoky voice sets the tone for a sultry soundscape.” With his clear vision and unwavering dedication to using music as a vessel for healing, Lew Apollo is quickly emerging as one of the most exciting new voices to watch in soul.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/lew-apollo/1662415706","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/lew.apollo/?hl=en","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/lewapollo","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1iclNC8eAt6q968DYNCmTY","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@lewapollo","website":"https://www.lewapollo.com/","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udPbMcqDgj0"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V1281","indoor_outdoor":"OUTDOOR\rTENT","name":"Zilker

Apollo is a rising force in modern soul, captivating audiences with his soul-stirring melodies and poignant songwriting. KUTX praised him as “the perfect summer vibe,” a fitting description for an artist whose music blends hypnotic guitar, cinematic production, and a sultry, smoky voice into lush, resonant soundscapes. Originally hailing from rural Barnum, MN, Lew’s artistry is deeply rooted in his home state’s heritage, fusing the legacies of Bob Dylan and Prince with modern influences like Hozier, Leon Bridges, and Labrinth.\nThe tragic loss of his father in 2022 profoundly shaped Lew’s songwriting, catalyzing a body of work that confronts themes of grief, isolation, and resilience while offering hope and connection. His debut EP JUNGLE, produced by BLK ODYSSY, introduced him as a bold new voice and fueled a run of sold-out shows at iconic Austin venues like The Pershing and Antone’s.\nSince then, Lew has taken his music to wider audiences, touring in support of Los Lonely Boys and earning airplay on KUTX with his single “Diamonds and Gold” as well as “Let the Light In” from his debut album. Self-produced from start to finish, Fool’s Gold has already surpassed 300,000 streams in under two months and is creating buzz for its fearless vulnerability and lush production. Press outlets have echoed the excitement: AMP Music declared “Lew Apollo will be a force in the R&B and pop stratospheres. Be warned,” while Earmilk praised how “Apollo’s signature smoky voice sets the tone for a sultry soundscape.” With his clear vision and unwavering dedication to using music as a vessel for healing, Lew Apollo is quickly emerging as one of the most exciting new voices to watch in soul.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"LEW APOLLO","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"udPbMcqDgj0","related_sales_client":null}

The four established band members - Greg Clayton (Rhythm guitar and vocals), Billy Alphin (drums), Danny Kurtz (lead guitar) and David Wright (bass guitar) - have collectively played in various major label and national touring bands through the years including Whiskeytown, AntiSeen, Drivin’ n Cryin', Flat Duo Jets, Squirrel Nut Zippers, The Backsliders, Sarah Shook, Lustre, and The Rosebuds (to name a few).  The new collective that is Dallas Tetnus is a musical combination of all of these influences, with a stage show that is packed with static energy and a pure rock showmanship that is one to be seen.\n\nThe band plays loud, short, catchy, 70s - inspired tunes with influences from The Ramones, The Stooges, and KISS. Their unique and original stage presence is hard to forget.

Tenus is a four piece rock band from Raleigh, North Carolina that formed in 2022 and includes a collective of members who have traveled the world playing and performing music.  The four established band members - Greg Clayton (Rhythm guitar and vocals), Billy Alphin (drums), Danny Kurtz (lead guitar) and David Wright (bass guitar) - have collectively played in various major label and national touring bands through the years including Whiskeytown, AntiSeen, Drivin’ n Cryin', Flat Duo Jets, Squirrel Nut Zippers, The Backsliders, Sarah Shook, Lustre, and The Rosebuds (to name a few).  The new collective that is Dallas Tetnus is a musical combination of all of these influences, with a stage show that is packed with static energy and a pure rock showmanship that is one to be seen.\n\nThe band plays loud, short, catchy, 70s - inspired tunes with influences from The Ramones, The Stooges, and KISS. Their unique and original stage presence is hard to forget. Their shows have plenty of visual appeal and engagement with smoke and bubbles rolling through every set, with white suits and a pink lit backdrop to boot.  \n\nThe debut album, Welcome To Dallas Tetnus, is available everywhere now.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"DALLAS TETNUS","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":null,"related_sales_client":null}

Her feature\ndirectorial debut, SAME SAME BUT DIFFERENT, is a female-driven ensemble comedy\nhighlighting three women navigating the tensions of their cross-cultural relationships and the\npressures of modern life, friendship, and womanhood. It will premiere at SXSW 2026.\n\nHailing from a rich background in theatre, she earned her graduate degree in Acting at Harvard’s\nAmerican Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) and the Moscow Art Theatre (MXAT) before her focus\npivoted toward film. Lauren first stepped behind the camera with the short drama HONOR, an\nintimate, autobiographically inspired story about coming of age, coming out, and facing\nexpulsion from Brigham Young University. The film earned multiple awards and launched her\nnew path as a filmmaker. She followed this short debut with GEN V, which began an ongoing\ncreative partnership with actor-writer Dalia Rooni and secured the pair a development deal with\nAdi Shankar’s Bootleg Universe. The duo went on to make CLEAN SLATE, a recipient of the\nCollaborative Film Challenge Grand Jury Prize and a grant from Blackmagic Design, before\nembarking to make their first feature film SAME SAME BUT DIFFERENT together.\n\nMost recently, Lauren co-wrote and starred in the Oscar Qualified short film, THE HEART OF\nTEXAS, which screened at more than 75 festivals worldwide and earned Lauren a dozen acting\nawards on the festival circuit for her performance as Janie May, a down-on-her-luck country\nsinger caught between a last shot at her dream and the crushing responsibility she bears for\nanother dreamer she collides with on her path. Across all of her work, Lauren is drawn to\nintimate, character-driven stories about ordinary people searching for grace and meaning in\nchaotic worlds. Her love for actors and their craft is undeniably infused into her directing style.\nShe approaches each project with honesty, humor, and deep compassion, crafting stories that\nreveal the beauty and hilarity of being human.","links":{"instagram":"https://instagram.com/laurencnoll"},"type":"person"}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":null,"floor":null,"id":"V0552","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Alamo

They are a band bound  by shared history, raw honesty, and a lived-in belief in the power of music to connect and heal. With voices that carry like old hymns and instrumentation that cuts with both grit and grace, their songs aren’t just played, they’re inhabited. There’s gospel in the bones, blues in the breath, and rock and roll in the resolve. Their debut album, Ain’t No Place to Be (2020), was recorded in Dripping Springs and released through Bearpath Records. It's an eight-track collection steeped in soul both sonically and spiritually featuring contributions from Anthony Farrell of The Greyhounds. Critics praised its emotional weight and its blend of warmth, pain, and resilience. Their latest single, The World Will Be Wood to You, recorded live to tape at DogStar Studios, is a raw, analog meditation on loss and grace. Written during quiet reckonings and bedside goodbyes, it holds ache and light in equal measure. It's an offering, a gesture toward gentleness in a fractured world. The Reverent Few remind us that tenderness still matters, that community still holds.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-reverent-few/1505904059","bandcamp":"https://thereverentfew.bandcamp.com","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/thereverentfew","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/thereverentfew/","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/thereverentfew","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/193wMhhpUuTYdYqtOS0V1Q","website":"https://thereverentfew.com/","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc73AtqncaE"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V0220","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Saxon

Reverent Few emerged from Chicago’s blues scene and have called Austin home for over a decade. They are a band bound  by shared history, raw honesty, and a lived-in belief in the power of music to connect and heal. With voices that carry like old hymns and instrumentation that cuts with both grit and grace, their songs aren’t just played, they’re inhabited. There’s gospel in the bones, blues in the breath, and rock and roll in the resolve. Their debut album, Ain’t No Place to Be (2020), was recorded in Dripping Springs and released through Bearpath Records. It's an eight-track collection steeped in soul both sonically and spiritually featuring contributions from Anthony Farrell of The Greyhounds. Critics praised its emotional weight and its blend of warmth, pain, and resilience. Their latest single, The World Will Be Wood to You, recorded live to tape at DogStar Studios, is a raw, analog meditation on loss and grace. Written during quiet reckonings and bedside goodbyes, it holds ache and light in equal measure. It's an offering, a gesture toward gentleness in a fractured world. The Reverent Few remind us that tenderness still matters, that community still holds.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"REVERENT FEW","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"cc73AtqncaE","related_sales_client":null}

Blending melodic sweetness with brooding dance beats, his self-described “melancholy disco” sound has earned over 25 million streams and global acclaim. Since emerging with the viral 2016 EP Poptimism (whose single “Try Much Harder” hit No. 9 on Spotify’s Global Viral Chart), Glassio has toured internationally with acts like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Nada Surf, and Electric Youth, and released two acclaimed LPs—For the Very Last Time (2020, Downtown Music) and See You Shine (2022)—with songs featured on Netflix and HBO. Raised between the Middle East and California and later based in New York and London, Sam draws influence from New Wave, 60s chamber pop, and early-2000s electronica, channeling it into rich, cinematic pop. His upcoming third album, The Imposter (2026), written during his move from New York to London, fuses shoegaze, folk, and dream pop in a neo-noir exploration of self-confrontation and creative rebirth. “I wanted this album to make people ask if they’re living the life they’re meant to,” he says. “For me, this is about rediscovering who I am as an artist.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/when-the-beat-carries-on/1844398478?i=1844398479","bandcamp":"https://glassio.bandcamp.com","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/glassiomusic","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/glassiomusic/","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/glassiomusic","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/702OtlyxGfqncjSvf8tFas?si=c277179c28614194","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@glassiomusic","website":"https://www.glassiomusic.com/","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvmm3BYhLL0"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V1464","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Las

is the Dream-Pop–tinged Indie-Dance project of Irish-Iranian songwriter and producer Sam R. Blending melodic sweetness with brooding dance beats, his self-described “melancholy disco” sound has earned over 25 million streams and global acclaim. Since emerging with the viral 2016 EP Poptimism (whose single “Try Much Harder” hit No. 9 on Spotify’s Global Viral Chart), Glassio has toured internationally with acts like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Nada Surf, and Electric Youth, and released two acclaimed LPs—For the Very Last Time (2020, Downtown Music) and See You Shine (2022)—with songs featured on Netflix and HBO. Raised between the Middle East and California and later based in New York and London, Sam draws influence from New Wave, 60s chamber pop, and early-2000s electronica, channeling it into rich, cinematic pop. His upcoming third album, The Imposter (2026), written during his move from New York to London, fuses shoegaze, folk, and dream pop in a neo-noir exploration of self-confrontation and creative rebirth. “I wanted this album to make people ask if they’re living the life they’re meant to,” he says. “For me, this is about rediscovering who I am as an artist.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"GLASSIO","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":true,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"qvmm3BYhLL0","related_sales_client":null}

From flight attendant school in Dallas to producing theater in New York City and teaching in Guatemala, Lloyd sought an adventurous life, but struggled to find a greater sense of purpose. That is, until she found her way back to music. Lloyd channels her restless spirit into songs that pay homage to her Appalachian roots while charting fresh territory for a sound that is uniquely her own. \n\nHeavily influenced by country, folk, and indie rock, Lloyd’s sound combines the rooted sounds of her traditional Appalachian upbringing with the fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants nature of her current life. She is inspired by the rich sounds of New York City, the peaceful quiet of her small West Virginia hometown, and life on the road in between.\n\nHer 2025 sophomore record \"Do It Myself\" landed her debut appearances at Mountain Stage, Americana Fest, and Brooklyn Folk Festival and her debut album, Loose Cannon, has been streamed over 1 million times while Olivia has been busy crossing the country opening for artists like Kelsey Waldon, Tommy Prine, and Jobi Riccio, winning songwriting contests (Kerrville in 2023), and generally eating life down to the

As they prepare to promote their debut album, due in April, the band is evolving its sound — keeping their regional rhythms and DIY spirit while weaving in samples, drum machines, and experimental, dance-driven styles. This collision of influences does true justice to the yonke in their name: raw, eclectic, and born from the beautiful chaos of the border. Recent milestones include a tour supporting Tropa Mágica and a standout performance at SXSW, solidifying their expanding live
