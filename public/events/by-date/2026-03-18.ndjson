With a solid trajectory within the industry, BrunOG has evolved from being a visionary producer—recognized even with a Latin Grammy nomination—to an established singer-songwriter with viral international impact. His image has always been synonymous with inspiration and aspiration.\nBrunOG’s musical proposal is a sonic blend rooted in Urban Latin Pop, yet it boldly ventures into genres such as Reggaeton, R&B, Afropop/Afrobeat, Hyperpop, Latin, and Alternative Pop. This versatility, however, always maintains a distinctive urban stamp in his lyrics, flows, and metrics, exploring themes of heartbreak, nostalgia, passionate love, sensuality, and romance.\nMilestones\nGlobal Viral Success: At 30, his track “Nuestra Canción” became an international phenomenon, driven by its inclusion in the soundtrack of the film “Culpa Mía.” \nSigning with Universal Music US Latin: In 2024, BrunOG joined the ranks of Universal Music US Latin, marking a new and exciting chapter in his career with multinational backing.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/es/song/nuestra-canci%C3%B3n-culpables-remix/1771901371","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/BrunOGmx/?locale=es_LA","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/brunog.mx/?hl=es","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/brunogmx","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/track/3sWuSJYhVQTIMkTfgwPgVR?si=916e8504639c4d56","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@brun.og","website":"https://brunog.musa.lat/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaeTV53195dO60_92nS6skE4knzW8KhBhUi2Bqjy7P_VdEJH6lZjqVgPtrzAuw_aem_3rF_bcq-ysMYbuPM2Xf5eA","youtube":"https://youtu.be/1OWcZB7U-DU?si=X2qcngTrKVwH-N_W"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V1464","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Las

Last year, during intensive chemo treatment for stage 3B colon cancer, as Walker contemplated what he might leave behind, and the way the meaning we assign to items evaporates if we’re not around to hold their memories, he started thinking about a new kind of character. As he processed his treatment and considered his worldly possessions, Walker decided to write an entire album about the inner lives of inanimate objects. Equally inspired by a childhood salvaging stuff from estate sales with his grandparents, and an upbringing colored by frugality and attention to the utility of everyday things, the resulting album, Stuff, will be released October 17 via East Dallas Records/Thirty Tigers.\n\nReckoning with cancer treatment and his own mortality, Walker also grieved a creative life — that he had more left to give — potentially cut short. Much like the items abandoned at an estate sale, he knew he too had more worth. “Both my grandparents found value in things that had life left in them,” Walker says. “At the time of writing these songs, I was really hoping that I had a second shot, some more life left in me, and I think that I projected that on a lot of these characters.”\n\nStuff begins with the title track, setting the scene and the stakes for the album: “Why wait until it’s gone / to find out what matters,” Walker sings. “Heirlooms and trinkets and pretty things/ we’re all just stuff when you’re not around / sometimes what’s lost just can’t be found.” Each track imagines the internal monologue of a household item for sale on the lawn at an estate sale: a Barbie doll, pruning shears, a radio, a trusty suit, a half-used bottle of perfume, and even a basso profundo-voiced bowling ball afraid he’s about to be benched: “checking in at the pro shop for maintenance and repairs / how many frames do I have left doc? / Do I have some time to spare?”\n\nSome items on Stuff, Walker knows personally, like the “Brick” his family kept around to prop doors open and table legs up, and to keep car tires from rolling during repair jobs. These bricks came from the neighborhood filling station — a 1940s-style full-service joint whose grizzled attendants always gave Walker a snack to munch in the back of his dad’s Chevy while they waited. The night after developers tore the station down under cover of darkness, Walker and his father returned to the rubble to steal a few bricks as keepsakes and tools. And “Perfume” is Walker’s sensuous, longing, personification of the half-empty bottles of Chanel No. 9 his grandma collected at estate sales and lined up on her vanity. She’s yet another in a long line of Walker’s signature heart broke characters, who implores, “do you still smell me on your sheets / and when you do, does your heart skip a beat?”\n\nThe world needs connection and empathy, now more than ever. Walker hopes that by relating to these inanimate characters, listeners will learn to better connect to living ones, too. “It's probably lofty to think that an album about bowling balls and Barbie dolls is going to make people think about their relationship with their neighbors or community,” he says. “But maybe subconsciously, if people can connect with these things that aren't even people, it'll make them a little better at connecting with people.”\n\nLike his June release, Tropicana, Walker wrote Stuff during cancer treatment. For him, the albums constitute two sides of the proverbial coin. Hospitals are innately devoid of creativity, utilitarian and harsh by their very nature, and Walker found himself oscillating between a gripping need to escape — say to a beach in Tropicana — and contemplating his own legacy and the Stuff in his life. And, when he was briefly misdiagnosed with stage 4 cancer (later updated to a clean scan), Walker started to push himself creatively, resolving to release three albums (of which Stuff is the second) in whatever time he had left.\n\nAt times of reflection, human beings often return to the moments that shaped them. On Stuff, Walker draws from the music he listened to as a teenager — Bon Iver, Beirut, The Postal Service, and Ben Gibbard — and nostalgic, formative moments. On “Barbie” and “Telephone” — the album’s most pop-influenced tracks — childhood and teenage memories play through two of youth’s fondest objects. On “Barbie,” disinterested in the Barbie and Ken love story, Walker reimagines Barbie as an independent woman lusting after GI Joe. And over a beat worthy of a Friday-night roller rink party, on “Telephone” Walker memorializes the landline — once a focal point of American homes and teenage years — and the source of sleepover mischief and long, covert, late-night conversations.\n\n“People put a lot of their personal opinions and meaning into art,” Walker says of the many details he included on the album. “Art isn't there for people to interpret so they can be...","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/canyon/1684588825?i=1684588835","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/joshuaraywalkermusic","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/joshuaraywalker/","pandora":"https://www.pandora.com/artist/joshua-ray-walker/glad-you-made-it/play-you-a-song/TRfVflKc9vg9PmP","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/4bsmxYIlAsApRfvopNMFdb?si=f074e870a7504c90","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@joshuaraywalker","twitter":"https://twitter.com/raywalkerjoshua","website":"https://www.joshuaraywalker.com/","youtube":"https://youtu.be/hJpGE6rjTJ8?si=J2jc5lknkSur-tN_"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V0220","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Saxon

The band takes their inspiration from the neo-psychedelic era of the 80s and 90s (The Jesus and Mary Chain, Spacemen 3, Primal Scream) and pulls it into the future with modulating synthesizers, heavy guitars, bouncing bass lines, and spiraling hooks, creating a narcotic blend of noise and melody. DAIISTAR recorded their first studio album produced by Alex Maas of The Black Angels and engineered by James Petralli of White Denim in the summer of 2021. The band signed to UK based label Fuzz Club Records with their debut album GOOD TIME released on September 8th 2023. The album is available on vinyl including a Levitation Exclusive Edition pressing, as well as CD and digital. DAIISTAR has performed at ACL, SXSW, Levitation Austin, Levitation France, Austin Psych Fest, Barcelona Psych Fest, KEXP, KUTX and has toured with The Black Angels, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, and The Dandy Warhols.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/us/song/star-starter/1737000195","bandcamp":"https://daiistar.bandcamp.com/music","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/daiistarr/","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/daiistar","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/15B1QXL3II5tvAlNdQzdvX?si=9ea1cce8553a479d","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@daiistar","twitter":"https://x.com/DAIISTARR","website":"https://www.daiistar.com/","youtube":"https://youtu.be/34LyN0suK_k?si=RoGFAGUnAtU00cxY"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V0248","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Valhalla","parent_id":null,"parent_venue_name":null,"venue_entry_info":null,"formats":null,"location":{"address":"710

 \nDAIISTAR is an Alt-Indie band formed in Austin, Texas in the spring of 2020. The band takes their inspiration from the neo-psychedelic era of the 80s and 90s (The Jesus and Mary Chain, Spacemen 3, Primal Scream) and pulls it into the future with modulating synthesizers, heavy guitars, bouncing bass lines, and spiraling hooks, creating a narcotic blend of noise and melody. DAIISTAR recorded their first studio album produced by Alex Maas of The Black Angels and engineered by James Petralli of White Denim in the summer of 2021. The band signed to UK based label Fuzz Club Records with their debut album GOOD TIME released on September 8th 2023. The album is available on vinyl including a Levitation Exclusive Edition pressing, as well as CD and digital. DAIISTAR has performed at ACL, SXSW, Levitation Austin, Levitation France, Austin Psych Fest, Barcelona Psych Fest, KEXP, KUTX and has toured with The Black Angels, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, and The Dandy Warhols.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"DAIISTAR","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"34LyN0suK_k","related_sales_client":null}

Raised in the hills of Laurel Canyon, her musical roots connect deeply to nature, vinyl, and the historic lady of the canyon, Joni Mitchell, as well as other female rock and pop icons Kate Bush, Tori Amos and PJ Harvey. Bates is a classically trained pianist, multi-instrumentalist, composer, producer who weaves lush vocal harmonies through pop, rock, and folk styles in her original songs, all showcased on her upcoming debut LP, 'Love and Power.' The LP is set for release in spring of 2026, on Gravel and Echo Recordings, distributed by Virgin Music Group. Bates’ elegant vocal arrangements, cinematic songwriting and multi-instrumental prowess sparks the ears of engaged music lovers, lyrically following the journey of a woman exploring her inner power and strength to take agency of life, love and relationships. Recorded and produced in her Laurel Canyon studio, ‘Love and Power’ is a manifestation of Lola’s depth as a composer and producer, making this a fully realized 10-song album, in collaboration with co-producer Maxwell Joseph, Grammy award winning engineer, Robert Carranza, and executive producer Tyler Bates.","links":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/lolabatesmusic/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/iamlolabates/","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@imlolabates?_r=1&_t=ZP-93hoA880FrC","twitter":"https://x.com/lolabatesmusic","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/@lolabatesmusic"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":null,"floor":null,"id":"V0900","indoor_outdoor":null,"name":"Wanderlust

Bates is not your traditional singer songwriter. Raised in the hills of Laurel Canyon, her musical roots connect deeply to nature, vinyl, and the historic lady of the canyon, Joni Mitchell, as well as other female rock and pop icons Kate Bush, Tori Amos and PJ Harvey. Bates is a classically trained pianist, multi-instrumentalist, composer, producer who weaves lush vocal harmonies through pop, rock, and folk styles in her original songs, all showcased on her upcoming debut LP, 'Love and Power.' The LP is set for release in spring of 2026, on Gravel and Echo Recordings, distributed by Virgin Music Group. Bates’ elegant vocal arrangements, cinematic songwriting and multi-instrumental prowess sparks the ears of engaged music lovers, lyrically following the journey of a woman exploring her inner power and strength to take agency of life, love and relationships. Recorded and produced in her Laurel Canyon studio, ‘Love and Power’ is a manifestation of Lola’s depth as a composer and producer, making this a fully realized 10-song album, in collaboration with co-producer Maxwell Joseph, Grammy award winning engineer, Robert Carranza, and executive producer Tyler Bates.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"LOLA BATES","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":null,"related_sales_client":null}

Cole, Kendrick Lamar, and Nipsey Hussle. What began as inspiration evolved into intention as Ozer matured—transforming lived experience into honest, reflective songwriting grounded in execution, flow, and substance. Following the release of his latest EP Fog City, he has shared stages with Westside Boogie, Topaz Jones, Trayce Chapman, YGTUT, and more, solidifying his presence as a formidable and thoughtful emcee. A writer at heart and performer by nature, Ozer uses language as a lyrical canvas, drawing from the essence of real life to create music that resonates with clarity, purpose, and lasting impact.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ozer/1262693592","bandcamp":"https://ozer.bandcamp.com/music","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/ozersf/","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/ozersf","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3J0qyBq8miao9sTXOlAkWp?si=t_iHHKuWTf-wtUZD2DmhCg","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ozersf","website":"https://www.freshxscoops.com/artists/ozer","youtube":"https://youtu.be/I9bqeF0J5no?si=wlblJvKyTSziruZe"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"All

San Francisco’s own, has been cultivating his lyrical voice since the age of six, first turning to music as a refuge from life’s challenges and later sharpening his craft through the influence of artists like J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, and Nipsey Hussle. What began as inspiration evolved into intention as Ozer matured—transforming lived experience into honest, reflective songwriting grounded in execution, flow, and substance. Following the release of his latest EP Fog City, he has shared stages with Westside Boogie, Topaz Jones, Trayce Chapman, YGTUT, and more, solidifying his presence as a formidable and thoughtful emcee. A writer at heart and performer by nature, Ozer uses language as a lyrical canvas, drawing from the essence of real life to create music that resonates with clarity, purpose, and lasting impact.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"OZER","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"I9bqeF0J5no","related_sales_client":null}

Blending melodic sweetness with brooding dance beats, his self-described “melancholy disco” sound has earned over 25 million streams and global acclaim. Since emerging with the viral 2016 EP Poptimism (whose single “Try Much Harder” hit No. 9 on Spotify’s Global Viral Chart), Glassio has toured internationally with acts like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Nada Surf, and Electric Youth, and released two acclaimed LPs—For the Very Last Time (2020, Downtown Music) and See You Shine (2022)—with songs featured on Netflix and HBO. Raised between the Middle East and California and later based in New York and London, Sam draws influence from New Wave, 60s chamber pop, and early-2000s electronica, channeling it into rich, cinematic pop. His upcoming third album, The Imposter (2026), written during his move from New York to London, fuses shoegaze, folk, and dream pop in a neo-noir exploration of self-confrontation and creative rebirth. “I wanted this album to make people ask if they’re living the life they’re meant to,” he says. “For me, this is about rediscovering who I am as an artist.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/when-the-beat-carries-on/1844398478?i=1844398479","bandcamp":"https://glassio.bandcamp.com","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/glassiomusic","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/glassiomusic/","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/glassiomusic","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/702OtlyxGfqncjSvf8tFas?si=c277179c28614194","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@glassiomusic","website":"https://www.glassiomusic.com/","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvmm3BYhLL0"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":null,"floor":null,"id":"V0900","indoor_outdoor":null,"name":"Wanderlust

Her 2023 EP Death by Laundry featured the breakout single “2:00am,” now streamed over 7.5 million times on Spotify, and earned support from BBC Introducing, BBC Radio 1, The Line of Best Fit, Clash, Nialler9, and Spotify editorial playlists. The first single from her upcoming album, “22 Angel,” has already reached 80,000 streams and was featured on New Pop UK.\n\nSarah has toured the UK supporting acts including Florence Road, U.S. Girls, and Bombay Bicycle Club, with highlights such as a performance at the O2 Forum London alongside CMAT. Now independent and on the verge of her debut album - created entirely by women and inspired by the myth of Calypso - Crean explores heartbreak, home, and everything in between. With the album due mid-2026, she is emerging as one of alt-indie pop’s most compelling new voices.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/ie/album/22-angel/1824870825?i=1824871366","bandcamp":"https://sarahcrean.bandcamp.com","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/sarahcreanmusic/","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/sarahcrean","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/0BmKyrd9iylAJwaifobkd7?si=fdf8251ba3fc4e41","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahcreanmusic","twitter":"https://x.com/sarahcreanmusic","youtube":"https://youtu.be/E9R2dhtM8CY?si=RHAPuqpnI0rWhzIL"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":null,"floor":null,"id":"V0900","indoor_outdoor":null,"name":"Wanderlust

artist Sarah Crean is an indie-pop singer-songwriter whose music combines emotional clarity with layered, melodic arrangements. Her 2023 EP Death by Laundry featured the breakout single “2:00am,” now streamed over 7.5 million times on Spotify, and earned support from BBC Introducing, BBC Radio 1, The Line of Best Fit, Clash, Nialler9, and Spotify editorial playlists. The first single from her upcoming album, “22 Angel,” has already reached 80,000 streams and was featured on New Pop UK.\n\nSarah has toured the UK supporting acts including Florence Road, U.S. Girls, and Bombay Bicycle Club, with highlights such as a performance at the O2 Forum London alongside CMAT. Now independent and on the verge of her debut album - created entirely by women and inspired by the myth of Calypso - Crean explores heartbreak, home, and everything in between. With the album due mid-2026, she is emerging as one of alt-indie pop’s most compelling new voices.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"SARAH CREAN","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"E9R2dhtM8CY","related_sales_client":null}

Each track is a vignette of life, steeped in nostalgia, resilience and a yearning to belong. It’s music that’s as much about catharsis as it is about connection.\r\n\r\nFirst single ‘Transgressions’ is a confessional anthem. Nostalgia and identity are painted vividly in the second single as the band retrace childhood, its warmth underpinning an unflinching honesty.\r\n\r\nYet it’s the title track which lies at the emotional heart of this debut. Empathy is portrayed as both gift and curse, a force that connects deeply to others’ pain, yet at times threatens to overwhelm.\r\n\r\nIt’s a debut album that’s as unguarded and unflinching as the band themselves, sure to resonate with anyone whose heart has ever felt too full.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/gb/album/transgressions/1839563118?i=1839563623","bandcamp":"https://kingno-one.bandcamp.com/music","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/KNOmusicUK/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/knomusicuk/","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/knomusicuk","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/3OWhkIi8AZH03ZQCOPCAGS?si=ed8aca6b979f444d","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@knomusicuk","twitter":"https://x.com/KNOmusicJP","website":"https://www.kingno-one.com/","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ78lfS30as"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V1168","indoor_outdoor":"OUTDOOR","name":"Low

a name as regal as their ambition, KNO are reshaping boundaries as they set out to release their debut album in April 2026.\r\n\r\nThis charismatic trio built their reputation through relentless touring and a catalogue of singles that bristle with both confidence and vulnerability.\r\n\r\nGlistening guitar riffs, punchy rhythms and poetic narratives ensure their sound is both urgent and heartfelt.\r\n\r\nThese narratives are channelled into lyrics that are as revealing as they are relatable.\r\n\r\nThe songwriting is a testament to their roots. Each track is a vignette of life, steeped in nostalgia, resilience and a yearning to belong. It’s music that’s as much about catharsis as it is about connection.\r\n\r\nFirst single ‘Transgressions’ is a confessional anthem. Nostalgia and identity are painted vividly in the second single as the band retrace childhood, its warmth underpinning an unflinching honesty.\r\n\r\nYet it’s the title track which lies at the emotional heart of this debut. Empathy is portrayed as both gift and curse, a force that connects deeply to others’ pain, yet at times threatens to overwhelm.\r\n\r\nIt’s a debut album that’s as unguarded and unflinching as the band themselves, sure to resonate with anyone whose heart has ever felt too full.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"KING NO-ONE","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"uZ78lfS30as","related_sales_client":null}

As an academic, he is particularly interested in the First Amendment and copyright, especially fair use.  He  teaches Film Law, Entertainment Transactions, and Art Law at the University of Michigan Law School. He's written about fair use for The Atlantic, and has appeared on CNN and CBS News Prime Time to discuss the doctrine's importance. Paul is also a filmmaker. His documentaries have been featured on the New York Times (Op-Docs), the Atlantic, The New Yorker, and Aeon, and have been shown at festivals internationally, including AFI Docs, Big Sky, Clermont-Ferrand, Doc NYC, Palm Springs, Slamdance, and Toronto International Film Festival (Kids). Paul is a graduate of Yale Law School and Columbia University. In the past, he played loud drums with loud bands in a bunch of loud places, including CBGBs. He also started coding in 7th grade, and he's still an occasional software developer (mostly Python and Java). He likes old jazz records, even older trains, and every dog he's ever met.","links":{},"type":"person"}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":null,"floor":null,"id":"V2191","indoor_outdoor":null,"name":"Guadalupe","parent_id":"V0353","parent_venue_name":"Courtyard

Raised in Australia and having lived in London for 12 years before relocating to Madrid, she brings an international perspective to how innovation is adopted globally.\n\nHer work sits at the convergence of AI strategy, human-centred design and commercial execution. Having led transformation initiatives across Consumer Goods, Media, Retail, and start-ups, Vanya brings a pragmatic perspective on what it really takes to implement technology at scale—beyond pilots, hype, or theoretical promise.\n\nMost recently, as a Global Director at Coca-Cola Europacific Partners covering 31 countries, she has shaped and delivered digital strategies for Procurement with a focus on emerging AI. Vanya began her career in management consulting at Accenture, delivering complex transformation programmes across Europe, Australia, and Asia.\n\nShe is also the founder and CEO of Travelhers Ltd., a London startup, connecting women globally and empowering safer travel through AI. She is driven by a belief that technology should improve lives - not just processes, a principle that runs through both her corporate and entrepreneurial work.\nWith degrees in Business and Political Sciences and a Business Strategy certification from INSEAD, Vanya brings a multidisciplinary lens to every stage she speaks on. She is a frequent conference guest across Europe, known for demystifying AI, challenging organisational inertia, and addressing the human realities behind digital transformation.\n\nVanya often draws on her experience as a third culture kid and speaks candidly about the people and culture side of transformations, the human dynamics behind change, why AI succeeds or fails, and what it takes to prepare people for the next generation of intelligent systems.","links":{},"type":"person"}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":null,"floor":"4","id":"V0367","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Room

Feist is a multi-platinum producer, songwriter, and music executive, and the Founder &amp; CEO of Hitmakers Entertainment. His career spans more than three decades across global markets, contributing to 35M+ records sold and hundreds of millions of streams worldwide. He has written and produced for Beyoncé, Destiny’s Child, Mary J. Blige, Kelly Rowland, Céline Dion, John Legend, Natalie Cole, George Clinton, Tyga, The Game, and others. Feist began composing commercially at 13, achieved his first international success at 18, and by his mid-20s had delivered more than 40 gold and platinum albums across Asia before relocating permanently to Los Angeles. His U.S. breakthrough came with “I Love You” (MCA) for Keith Washington and Chanté Moore, followed by extensive major-label work throughout the 1990s and 2000s. In 2016, Feist founded Hitmakers Entertainment in response to structural weaknesses in the modern label model. He shifted from hit-driven execution to building artist ecosystems engineered for the post-streaming era—prioritizing catalog depth, ownership, algorithmic confidence, and repeat listener behavior over ad spend, radio dependency, or forced virality.

He later became the manager of a DIY rock band, touring the U.S. several times in his early 20s. It was a dream job, but came with little pay, no benefits, and no notice before it ended. Randy worked much of the 90s at Southwest Wholesale, a historically important outlet for Texas Rap and other regional music, serving as the initial CD and cassette distributor for many classic releases. During the same decade, Mr. Haaga opened a CD shop and launched an online store focused on the Texas underground rap scene that originated at Southwest Wholesale. The online store was among the first to distribute DJ Screw mixtapes, Swishahouse, Slim Thug’s Boss Hogg Outlawz, and other Texas legends to the world.\r\rThen, as the digital era began and physical product sales declined, Mr. Haaga was in the right place at the right time. He launched SoSouth Music Distribution in 2005, when iTunes was only two years old—years before Spotify was launched. The service quickly gained traction, attracting hundreds of significant customers within the first few years. Randy worked with artists and catalogs such as DJ Screw, Big Moe, Lil’ Keke, Slim Thug, Z-Ro, and later breakout acts like Megan Thee Stallion and Finesse2Tymes, among others. Mr. Haaga continues to be the president of SoSouth Music Distribution, now distributing via Virgin Music Group, a part of Universal Music, along with the added service of SoSouth’s music publishing administration, which is partnered directly with Universal Music Publishing worldwide.","links":{},"type":"person"}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":null,"floor":null,"id":"V2407","indoor_outdoor":null,"name":"Tannehill","parent_id":"V2427","parent_venue_name":"Downright

As Secretary, he was responsible for successfully executing President Donald J. Trump’s energy agenda and the expansive mission of the Department of Energy (DOE), including maintaining the safety and security of the nation’s nuclear arsenal, protecting the electric grid from cyber threats, ensuring access to reliable and affordable energy, overseeing scientific research and development, and promoting the development and export of American technology and energy all over the world. Under his leadership, the nation ushered in a historic energy era, becoming the number one producer of oil and gas in the world, a world leader in the production and generation of renewable energy, and the dominant global force in Supercomputing, Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence. \r\rPrior to joining the Trump Administration, Perry served as the 47th Governor of Texas from 2000-2015. As the longest serving governor of the Lone Star State, he championed conservative pro-growth principles that made Texas the world’s 12th largest economy and the economic envy of America. During his time in Austin, Governor Perry also implemented transformative reforms in the areas of security, criminal justice reform, energy, education, healthcare and the economy. \r\rAs Chief Executive both as Governor of Texas and Secretary of Energy, Perry understood that the success of government is only as strong as its partnerships with the private sector. He advocated for smart regulatory reforms and strong public-private partnerships, empowering industry rather that creating more bureaucratic barriers. He started the Texas Enterprise Fund which lured hundreds of millions of dollars in private sector business and jobs to Texas. At DOE, he appointed the first ever Chief Commercialization Officer who was tasked with bridging the gap between the world-class R&D at the Department’s 17 National Laboratories and commercialization in the private sector. \r\rRick Perry is a veteran of the United States Air Force, where he flew a C-130 tactical airlift aircraft in Europe and the Middle East. Throughout his career, he has been deeply involved in supporting both the active duty and veteran community, most recently as an advocate for using the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deliver precision health care to warriors suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and other conditions.\r\rPerry earned distinction early in his life as an Eagle Scout. He was one of the first in his family to go to college, earning a degree in Animal Science from Texas A&M University, where he was a member of the Corps of Cadets and a Yell Leader. He is a lifetime member of both the NRA and American Legion Post #75.\r\rPerry married his childhood sweetheart, Anita, in 1982. They have two children, two beautiful granddaughters, and two handsome grandsons.

innovation arm, FirstBuild, has flipped the script—inviting passionate enthusiasts to co-create products from day one. The result is a 93% failure rate that just so happens to drive million-dollar successes like the Opal Nugget Ice Maker, which raised $2.7 million in crowdfunding after the community helped shape its development.

Most recently, his work on The Psychedelic Furs’ latest album contributed to a remarkable milestone—UK Top Ten albums across five consecutive decades.\r\rA key highlight of Tim’s career is mixing Ten by Pearl Jam, one of the 50 best-selling albums of all time, which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2021. He also received a Grammy nomination in 2001 for his work on U2’s All That You Can’t Leave Behind, which won the Grammy for Best Rock Album. That same record featured the Grammy-winning tracks Stuck in a Moment and Elevation, both mixed by Tim.\r\rNow based in Austin, Texas, Tim continues to collaborate with artists including Tears for Fears, Jason Mraz, Blue October, The Polyphonic Spree, H.I.M., and The Psychedelic Furs. In 2014, he mixed Billy Childs’ Map to the Treasure, an album that received three Grammy nominations.\r\rIn recent years, Tim has worked alongside Grammy-winning producer Larry Klein, mixing projects for Kandace Springs, Lang Lang, Lizz Wright, Luciana Souza, and two multi-artist jazz tributes to Charlie Parker and Jacques Brel. He also co-produced Ville Valo’s (VV) latest album, which debuted at #4 in Germany, and mixed The Tipping Point by Tears for Fears, which reached #8 on the Billboard 200.\r\rBeyond the studio, Tim has served two terms as a Recording Academy Trustee and sits on the advisory board of Sonic Guild (formerly Black Fret), an Austin-based nonprofit supporting local musicians. Over the past four years, Sonic Guild has provided more than $3.5 million in grants and performance payments to Austin’s vibrant music community.","links":{},"type":"person"}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":null,"floor":null,"id":"V2407","indoor_outdoor":null,"name":"Tannehill","parent_id":"V2427","parent_venue_name":"Downright

His now-iconic “eroded” aesthetic—artifacts rendered as if excavated from the future—has become a signature visual language that speaks to impermanence, nostalgia, and transformation. Born in Cleveland and raised in Miami, Arsham became the youngest artist ever to work with legendary choreographer Merce Cunningham. His work is in the collections of the world's most acclaimed museums and he has collaborated with major brands from Dior to Adidas. He is the author of Future Relic: Failures, Disasters, Detours, and How I Made a Career as an Artist.

Morgan has completed more than 50 jury and bench trials, six appellate court oral arguments before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and Alaska Court of Appeals, and resolved dozens of cases by negotiation.\r\rMorgan’s first case at Lambda was in 2025, when she joined a trial team that successfully fought for the Constitutional rights of an incarcerated transgender woman in Alaska who needed gender-affirming surgery.\r\rBefore joining Lambda, Morgan served longer than eight years as an Assistant United States Attorney in the District of Alaska, where she investigated and prosecuted a wide variety of cases, including civil rights, environmental, national security, white-collar and transnational crimes, and child exploitation. Morgan’s special projects include serving as coordinator of the Anti-Terrorism Advisory Committee, Civil Rights Coordinator, and mentor for other attorneys.\r\rIn 2022, Morgan was detailed to the American Embassy in Sri Lanka and U.S. Mission to Maldives, where she designed and delivered capacity-building programs for prosecutors and judges regarding counterterrorism, international financial crimes, digital evidence, and trauma-informed victim engagement. In her capacity as Justice Department leader at the mission, she served on the Embassy’s emergency-action committee during a political and economic crisis. In 2024, Morgan became one of the few (if only) transgender lawyers to prosecute a jury trial before transition and, later, after socially transitioning, defend the same conviction on appeal.\r\rEarlier, Morgan served as a state prosecutor for eight years, when she handled cases in urban and rural communities. Morgan focused on special-victims cases, involving minors and adults, and empowered dozens of survivors to testify. Morgan served as the deputy director of the Alaska Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, during which time she secured one of the largest contested restitution judgments in state history.\r\rMorgan’s prior legal work took her to American Samoa, where she served as both prosecutor and public defender, and to private practice in Seattle. Morgan earned her Juris Doctor in 2004 from the University of Minnesota Law School, where she was on the Dean’s List and participated in immigration and prosecution clinics. Morgan studied philosophy in politics at Earlham College.","links":{},"type":"person"},{"id":85197,"company":"a public school district in Texas","credential_types":["innovation"],"entity_id":2247198,"name":"Indigo Giles","speaker_types":[],"title":"Special Education Paraprofessional","image":{"alt_text":"Indigo Giles","credit":null,"url":"https://images.sxsw.com/1XOTfLEhLZQsZDUF94i_TBB-W5E=/803x68:1825x1090/600x600/images.sxsw.com/48/0e046d8c-dc19-4745-b5e2-749b56cbc4cb/pcid-1634543"},"speaker_type":"Speaker","details":"Indigo is an educator and activist who has been advocating for trans Texans for more than 5 years.

That same vision now guides her legislative work, where she has helped advance critical policies including the sickle cell disease registry and the burn pits registry fund, and played an instrumental role in the 2023 defeat of school vouchers through her work with Representative Abel Herrero on the landmark Herrero Amendment.\n\nWhat drives Mo’s work is both memory and vision. Hearing elders say they “already took on this fight” as the same battles resurface fuels her determination to keep pushing for equality and justice, so the next generation will not have to fight these same wars again.","links":{},"type":"person"},{"id":84985,"company":"Equality Texas","credential_types":["innovation"],"entity_id":2246961,"name":"Sofia Sepulveda","speaker_types":[],"title":"Field Director","image":{"alt_text":"Sofia Sepulveda","credit":"","url":"https://images.sxsw.com/f75WZ_LYwvyw_aKIP06TPTfY4vA=/2x0:255x253/600x600/images.sxsw.com/48/e3ee9211-68c0-4b44-b87c-fe6b53146487/pcid-1634336"},"speaker_type":"Speaker","details":"Sofia (she/her) is the Field Director at Equality Texas.

Her feature\ndirectorial debut, SAME SAME BUT DIFFERENT, is a female-driven ensemble comedy\nhighlighting three women navigating the tensions of their cross-cultural relationships and the\npressures of modern life, friendship, and womanhood. It will premiere at SXSW 2026.\n\nHailing from a rich background in theatre, she earned her graduate degree in Acting at Harvard’s\nAmerican Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) and the Moscow Art Theatre (MXAT) before her focus\npivoted toward film. Lauren first stepped behind the camera with the short drama HONOR, an\nintimate, autobiographically inspired story about coming of age, coming out, and facing\nexpulsion from Brigham Young University. The film earned multiple awards and launched her\nnew path as a filmmaker. She followed this short debut with GEN V, which began an ongoing\ncreative partnership with actor-writer Dalia Rooni and secured the pair a development deal with\nAdi Shankar’s Bootleg Universe. The duo went on to make CLEAN SLATE, a recipient of the\nCollaborative Film Challenge Grand Jury Prize and a grant from Blackmagic Design, before\nembarking to make their first feature film SAME SAME BUT DIFFERENT together.\n\nMost recently, Lauren co-wrote and starred in the Oscar Qualified short film, THE HEART OF\nTEXAS, which screened at more than 75 festivals worldwide and earned Lauren a dozen acting\nawards on the festival circuit for her performance as Janie May, a down-on-her-luck country\nsinger caught between a last shot at her dream and the crushing responsibility she bears for\nanother dreamer she collides with on her path. Across all of her work, Lauren is drawn to\nintimate, character-driven stories about ordinary people searching for grace and meaning in\nchaotic worlds. Her love for actors and their craft is undeniably infused into her directing style.\nShe approaches each project with honesty, humor, and deep compassion, crafting stories that\nreveal the beauty and hilarity of being human.","links":{"instagram":"https://instagram.com/laurencnoll"},"type":"person"}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":null,"floor":null,"id":"V0550","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Alamo Lamar 6","parent_id":"V0549","parent_venue_name":"Alamo Lamar","venue_entry_info":null,"formats":null,"location":{"address":"1120 S Lamar Blvd.","lat_lon":[30.2561977,-97.7635717],"city":"Austin","postal_code":"78704","state":"TX","name":"Alamo Lamar"},"root":{"accessible":null,"age_policy":"All Ages","floor":null,"id":"V0549","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Alamo Lamar","parent_id":null,"parent_venue_name":null,"venue_entry_info":null,"formats":null},"events":[{"id":"FS19388","track":"Visions","focus_area":null,"category":"Narrative Feature","event_id":"FS19388","event_type":"screening","format":"Narrative Feature","genre":"Horror","subgenre":"Gaming","name":"Dead Eyes","presented_by":null,"publish_at":"2026-02-04T14:00:00.000-06:00","reservable":true,"reservable_id":"FS19388","reserved":false,"date":"2026-03-12","end_time":"2026-03-12T16:21:00.000-05:00","start_time":"2026-03-12T15:00:00.000-05:00","message":null,"image":{"alt_text":"Dead Eyes","credit":"Dir: Richard E.

Her feature film \"Madeline’s Madeline\" thrusts the audience into the ever-shifting first-person perspective of her main character. \"Madeline’s Madeline,\" scripted through a devised process with ten actors, played Sundance, Berlinale and scores of festivals worldwide, was hailed as a “mind-scrambling masterpiece” (Indiewire) and was nominated for Best Picture at IFP’s Gotham Awards and for two Independent Spirit Awards. Said to be ushering in a “new grammar of narrative” by The New Yorker, Josephine’s other feature films have received many accolades: \"Shirley\" (starring Elisabeth Moss) won Sundance’s U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Auteur Filmmaking, \"The Sky Is Everywhere\" (A24/Apple) was a New York Times Critic’s Pick, and her first two features premiered together at Berlinale 2014 and went on to play scores of festival worldwide, winning awards and garnering a retrospective at the Torino Film Festival.\n \nShe wrote and directed a play with Pig Iron Theatre Company in Philadelphia in 2022, which explored complex decisions around pregnancy through a dream lens. Josephine performed from 2008 - 2015 with the Main Squeeze Orchestra, an all-female accordion orchestra in New York City, and she currently performs as part of a clown ensemble in Los Angeles led by Amrita Dhaliwal.  \n \nSince 2022, she has been making a documentary in collaboration with teen mothers in Dallas, Texas. Dallas offers limited access to contraception and health insurance and has the highest repeat teen pregnancy rate in the country. The teen mothers Josephine works with improvise, write and act in short films that create the backbone of the

Her momentum continued with her debut album American Doll (2025), a candid and self-aware body of work that explores desire, disillusionment, and identity with quiet confidence.

Known for his rich baritone and soaring, gritty rock vocals, Cano’s sound lives at the crossroads of high octane, blues driven rock ’n’ roll and vulnerable Americana balladry. His debut album, Every Rise of the Sun, is a raw chronicle of resilience and survival—equal parts cathartic release and anthemic triumph. Praised by outlets including Paste Magazine and Indie Current for its authenticity and emotional weight, the record established Cano as a voice unafraid to merge heartfelt intimacy with road-tested rock energy. Cano has toured across the US, performing everything from intimate listening rooms to major festivals. He has shared the stage with artists such as Plain White T's, Gin Blossoms, Tyler Bryant and the Shakedown, Band of Heathens, and Chris Barron. Along the way, he’s built a grassroots fanbase bound by a sense of community, connection, and resilience, values that run through all of his work. With a career already marked by resilience, authenticity, and growth, Alex Cano continues to carve his place as one of the most compelling voices in modern Rock/Americana.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/us/song/doin-it-wrong/1839737553","bandcamp":"https://alexcano.bandcamp.com","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/alexcanomusic","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/alexcanomusic","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/alexcanomusic","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/4rna00Nt8b1gWWA0igJLUL?si=c9954504193a47b2","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@alexcanomusic","website":"https://www.alexcanomusic.com","youtube":"https://youtu.be/GFLy0idrU2s?si=TQIkdQrF32cXmSFE"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V0197","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Lamberts","parent_id":null,"parent_venue_name":null,"venue_entry_info":null,"formats":null,"location":{"address":"401

Cano is a nationally touring Rock/Americana artist hailing from New York’s Hudson Valley. Known for his rich baritone and soaring, gritty rock vocals, Cano’s sound lives at the crossroads of high octane, blues driven rock ’n’ roll and vulnerable Americana balladry. His debut album, Every Rise of the Sun, is a raw chronicle of resilience and survival—equal parts cathartic release and anthemic triumph. Praised by outlets including Paste Magazine and Indie Current for its authenticity and emotional weight, the record established Cano as a voice unafraid to merge heartfelt intimacy with road-tested rock energy. Cano has toured across the US, performing everything from intimate listening rooms to major festivals. He has shared the stage with artists such as Plain White T's, Gin Blossoms, Tyler Bryant and the Shakedown, Band of Heathens, and Chris Barron. Along the way, he’s built a grassroots fanbase bound by a sense of community, connection, and resilience, values that run through all of his work. With a career already marked by resilience, authenticity, and growth, Alex Cano continues to carve his place as one of the most compelling voices in modern Rock/Americana.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"ALEX CANO","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"GFLy0idrU2s","related_sales_client":null}

The band started in February 2024, and has been steadily making its way into the Austin music scene ever since. Starting with a pop-forward garage rock EP, Cutie Core, released in April of 2025 and ending last year with a bang in October 2025 with the release of their more punk-forward EP “Hot Damn!” and an extra bonus punkified cover of Sheb Woolley’s “Purple People Eater,” CorMae are swiftly becoming an Austin Punk mainstay. The band are nominated by the Austin Chronicle for ATX’s 2025 Best Punk Band and you may also know them from opening shows for the likes of Of Montreal, Murder City Devils, and Pretty Girls Make Graves in 2025. CorMae’s songs are written about life, love, social, and economic struggles and their live show is aimed at commiserating on these issues with the audience. CorMae aims to build a community of friends and fans of all ages, creeds, races, and genders. After all, who doesn’t need a little cathartic shouting or a little dancing every once in a while?","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/us/song/vacay/1832054412","bandcamp":"https://cormae.bandcamp.com/music","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/share/17wrARuRbJ/?mibextid=wwXIfr","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/cormae_band?igsh=MTkyZngwNTN5NWdhZQ%3D%3D&utm_source=qr","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/0Cwapw2F4pprxhUh2sowPh?si=8bk7Wsn6SkKmS7LwjDCk5g","tiktok":"https://www.tiktok.com/@cormae7?_t=ZP-8ydiumUQvXj&_r=1","youtube":"https://youtu.be/robHlzCrds4?si=rkZYdiMQNGQZcGFT"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V1281","indoor_outdoor":"OUTDOOR\rTENT","name":"Zilker

started as a social media ad and a dream and now has evolved into an up and coming punk and riot grrrl inspired band. The band started in February 2024, and has been steadily making its way into the Austin music scene ever since. Starting with a pop-forward garage rock EP, Cutie Core, released in April of 2025 and ending last year with a bang in October 2025 with the release of their more punk-forward EP “Hot Damn!” and an extra bonus punkified cover of Sheb Woolley’s “Purple People Eater,” CorMae are swiftly becoming an Austin Punk mainstay. The band are nominated by the Austin Chronicle for ATX’s 2025 Best Punk Band and you may also know them from opening shows for the likes of Of Montreal, Murder City Devils, and Pretty Girls Make Graves in 2025. CorMae’s songs are written about life, love, social, and economic struggles and their live show is aimed at commiserating on these issues with the audience. CorMae aims to build a community of friends and fans of all ages, creeds, races, and genders. After all, who doesn’t need a little cathartic shouting or a little dancing every once in a while?","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"CORMAE","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"robHlzCrds4","related_sales_client":null}

Dub Gideon Band was founded in 2009 on the west side of San Antonio,Texas by a group of young men who were deeply inspired by Bob Marley and the spirit of RastafarI.  After the release of their first EP in 2011, titled \"Underworld EP in Dub\", and the follow up EP \"Live in Love\" (2012), the band quickly became a staple at all Reggae events around Central Texas and established itself as a force to be recognized,    Always rooted in the dub tradition the band started to become a backing outfit for artists in the area who they felt needed a platform to perform their music.  The band has backed amazing Texas, international, and Jamaican talent alike such as Likkle Shanx, Jahn TI, Chris Boomer, Island Rose, Moe Monsarrat, Dre Z Melodi, Mister Kali, General Smiley (Michigan and Smiley), Admiral Tibet, Warrior king, Tristan Palma, Spiritual, Luciano, and so many more. Currently based in Austin, the band has re-emerged with a collection of some of Austin's finest Reggae musicians alongside original members from San Antonio.   More than a band, Dub Gideon is a concept, and a force in the world of Reggae Music committed to upholding the true integrity of Roots and Culture Dub Music","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"DUB GIDEON","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"bj236W5yuE0","related_sales_client":null}

After a stint holding down drums for Dallas surf punks Sealion in high school, Baldwin went on to form the Psych Pop combo Acid Carousel, which he led for 6 years and 20 something releases before departing the band. Moving to Austin, Baldwin started quickly self releasing a string of singles and EPs on his own GetWithIt! Imprint and establishing himself as the godson of Texas Rock n Roll. Teaming up with former bandmates and friends Gus formed The Sketch in 2022. Embracing the aggression of dirty punk, the looseness of garage, and the charm of power pop, The Sketch established themselves as new cornerstones of the Austin rock scene. Recording their debut LP with the group in one day of recording in LA in the spring of 2024, “The Sketch” is the culmination of Baldwin’s vision, manifested through the power of The Sketch themselves. In late 2025, Baldwin released his first full length solo LP. With the selt-titled debut, Gus focuses in on his rock n' roll stylings, while at the same time showing great versatility as a songwriter. Not being afraid to mix opposite loves of Punk and Pop into one cohesive album.","links":{"apple":"https://music.apple.com/us/song/cherrywood/1838122390","bandcamp":"https://gusbaldwin.bandcamp.com/music","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/buddy_gus/?hl=en","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/6CQJbwVfdut9j6r1T7A24y?si=3be240bef7ac4892","website":"https://gusbaldwin.bandcamp.com/","youtube":"https://youtu.be/Jv2rs7apijQ?si=rMmatEmK4DY2HggZ"}}],"venue":{"accessible":false,"age_policy":"21+","floor":null,"id":"V0212","indoor_outdoor":"INDOOR","name":"Chess

Baldwin is a singer/songwriter/ex-hippie/part-time punk from Austin, TX. After a stint holding down drums for Dallas surf punks Sealion in high school, Baldwin went on to form the Psych Pop combo Acid Carousel, which he led for 6 years and 20 something releases before departing the band. Moving to Austin, Baldwin started quickly self releasing a string of singles and EPs on his own GetWithIt! Imprint and establishing himself as the godson of Texas Rock n Roll. Teaming up with former bandmates and friends Gus formed The Sketch in 2022. Embracing the aggression of dirty punk, the looseness of garage, and the charm of power pop, The Sketch established themselves as new cornerstones of the Austin rock scene. Recording their debut LP with the group in one day of recording in LA in the spring of 2024, “The Sketch” is the culmination of Baldwin’s vision, manifested through the power of The Sketch themselves. In late 2025, Baldwin released his first full length solo LP. With the selt-titled debut, Gus focuses in on his rock n' roll stylings, while at the same time showing great versatility as a songwriter. Not being afraid to mix opposite loves of Punk and Pop into one cohesive album.","meeting_url":null,"meeting_url_live":false,"mentorly_url":null,"mobile_audio_url":null,"open_captioned":false,"playlist_tag":null,"rebroadcast":false,"recommended_ids":[],"search_conversions":null,"short_program":false,"slido_url":null,"sort":"GUS BALDWIN & THE SKETCH","source":"Official","squad_up_url":null,"stream_embed":null,"stream_id":null,"stream_url":null,"strobe_warning":false,"subdiscipline":null,"summit":null,"summit_display_name":null,"tags":[],"talent_attending":null,"title_only":false,"track_display_name":null,"trailer_id":null,"trailer_url":null,"video_on_demand":null,"vimeo_id":null,"vod":false,"xr_project_type":null,"youtube_id":"Jv2rs7apijQ","related_sales_client":null}
